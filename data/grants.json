A SIMILAR STRATEGY TO PHASE I WILL BE IMPLEMENTED, CENTERED AROUND EFFECTIVELY IMPLEMENTING PROTOCOL P29, THROUGH THE FOLLOWING FIVE INTERMEDIATE OBJECTIVES (IOS):\n1) IO1: INCREASED KNOWLEDGE, AWARENESS, AND IMPLEMENTATION OF THE ILO PROTOCOL AND RECOMMENDATION;\n2) IO2: IMPROVED AND RESPONSIVE NATIONAL POLICIES, ACTION PLANS AND LEGISLATION ON FORCED LABOR WITH STRONG ENFORCEMENT MECHANISMS;\n3) IO3: INCREASED EFFORTS TO COLLECT RELIABLE NATIONAL STATISTICS IN ORDER TO CARRY OUT RESEARCH AND SHARE KNOWLEDGE ACROSS INSTITUTIONS AT NATIONAL, REGIONAL, AND GLOBAL LEVELS;\n4) IO4: WORKERS' AND EMPLOYERS' ORGANIZATIONS ACTIVELY SUPPORT THE FIGHT AGAINST FORCED LABOR; AND\n5) IO5: STRENGTHENED AWARENESS AND ACCESS TO SERVICES AND LIVELIHOOD PROGRAMS FOR VICTIMS OF FORCED LABOR.\nPHASE II OF THE BRIDGE PROJECT WILL ALSO AIM TO MAINSTREAM THE 'ACCELERATION FACTORS' WHICH ARE THE CORE PILLARS OF THE ILO 8.7 ACCELERATOR LAB INITIATIVE5. THIS INITIATIVE WAS CREATED TO ACCELERATE PROGRESS TOWARDS THE ERADICATION OF FORCED LABOR AND THE ELIMINATION OF CHILD LABOR BY OPTIMIZING THE EFFECTIVENESS OF DEVELOPMENT COOPERATION INTERVENTIONS BY EMBRACING SIX ACCELERATION FACTORS. THESE ACCELERATION FACTORS ARE BASED ON AN ASSESSMENT OF WHAT CAN EFFECT CHANGE FOR THE MOST VULNERABLE POPULATIONS IN A SHIFTING ENVIRONMENT, HELPING ADDRESS GAPS IN PROGRAMMING, WHILST COMBINING BOTH FORWARD-LOOKING INNOVATION AND SCALING OF EFFECTIVE PRACTICES.\n\nDELIVERABLES\nSINCE 2015, THE ILO HAS SUPPORTED THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THIS STRATEGY THROUGH THE USDOL-FUNDED PROJECT \"FROM PROTOCOL TO PRACTICE: A BRIDGE TO GLOBAL ACTION ON FORCED LABOR (THE BRIDGE PROJECT)\". THE PROJECT CONTRIBUTED TO INCREASING GLOBAL EFFORTS TO ELIMINATE FORCED LABOR BY IMPROVING COUNTRIES' CAPACITY TO TACKLE THE ISSUE. THE PROJECT WORKED GLOBALLY AND IN SIX PILOT COUNTRIES - MALAYSIA, MAURITANIA, NEPAL, NIGER, PERU AND UZBEKISTAN - TO STRENGTHEN THE CAPACITY OF GOVERNMENTS, EMPLOYERS' AND WORKERS' ORGANIZATIONS, VULNERABLE POPULATIONS AND OTHER KEY STAKEHOLDERS. THE PROJECT'S FOCUS WAS TO INCREASE KNOWLEDGE, AWARENESS AND RATIFICATIONS OF THE ILO PROTOCOL; IMPROVE AND DEVELOP RESPONSIVE NATIONAL POLICIES, ACTIONS AND LEGISLATION ON FORCED LABOR; UNDERTAKE RESEARCH AND SHARE KNOWLEDGE ON FORCED LABOR; STRENGTHEN WORKERS' AND EMPLOYERS' ORGANIZATIONS TO SUPPORT THE FIGHT AGAINST FORCED LABOR, AND INCREASE THE AWARENESS OF AND ACCESS TO SERVICES AND LIVELIHOOD PROGRAMS FOR VICTIMS OF FORCED LABOR.\n\nINTENDED BENEFICIARY\nTHE SECOND PHASE OF THE BRIDGE PROJECT WILL ENABLE THE ILO TO CONTINUE TO BUILD ON THE ACCOMPLISHMENTS AND LESSONS LEARNT FROM THE FIRST PHASE6, WHILE ALSO TARGETING NEW SECTORS, COUNTRIES, AND VULNERABLE GROUPS. PHASE II WILL BE IMPLEMENTED AT GLOBAL LEVEL, REGIONAL LEVEL AND IN 5 PRIORITY COUNTRIES.\n\nTHE REGIONAL COMPONENT WILL COVER SELECTED PACIFIC ISLAND COUNTRIES (MARSHALL ISLANDS, PALAU, TONGA, TUVALU AND PAPUA NEW GUINEA), WITH A FOCUS ON PROMOTING THE RATIFICATION OF PROTOCOL 29 AND CONVENTION 29, AS 4 OUT OF THE 7 COUNTRIES THAT HAVE NOT RATIFIED CONVENTION 29 ARE IN THE PACIFIC. THE MARSHALL ISLANDS, PALAU, TONGA, AND PAPUA NEW GUINEA ALSO APPEAR ON THE UNITED STATES GOVERNMENT TRAFFICKING IN PERSONS TIER 2 WATCH LIST, FOR THE LACK OF EFFECTIVE IDENTIFICATION OF VICTIMS, AND INSUFFICIENT PROSECUTION AND CONVICTIONS OF TRAFFICKING CASES, INCLUDING THE CASE OF MIGRANT WORKERS TRAFFICKED FOR LABOR EXPLOITATION.\n\nTHE PROJECT'S FIVE PRIORITY COUNTRIES WILL INCLUDE THREE FROM PHASE I - NEPAL, PERU AND UZBEKISTAN - WHERE THE PROJECT WILL SCALE UP KEY INTERVENTIONS THAT WILL POTENTIALLY HAVE A LARGE IMPACT ON THESE COUNTRIES' CAPACITY TO SUSTAINABLY ADDRESS FORCED LABOR. THESE INCLUDE THE RATIFICATION OF THE PROTOCOL AND THE ADOPTION OF A NEW FORCED LABOR LAW THAT WILL PROTECT ALL BONDED LABORERS IN NEPAL; AND THE DEVELOPMENT OF A NATIONAL POLICY ON FORCED LABOR AND THE PROVISION OF LIVELIHOOD SERVICES TO VICTIMS IN PERU. UZBEKISTAN WAS ADDED AS A BRIDGE PHASE I COUNTRY IN 2021, WITH ACTIVITIES FOCUSED ON ADVOCACY, AWARENESS RAISING AND CAPACITY BUILDING OF LABOR INSPECTORS (IO1 AND IO2). FOLLOWING THE CLOSURE OF THE THIRD PARTY MONITORING PROJECT IN 2022, THERE IS NOW THE NEED TO SUPPORT THE GOVERNMENT ON SAFEGUARDING THE ACHIEVEMENTS MADE IN THE COTTON SECTOR, BY ENSURING A MAINTAINABLE TRANSITION TO A MORE SUSTAINABLE APPROACH, THAT GOES BEYOND THE MONITORING/MEASUREMENT, BASED ON THE REINFORCEMENT OF LABOR INSPECTION (I.E. THE LABOR ADMINISTRATION INSTITUTION THAT, ACCORDING TO THE INTERNATIONAL LABOR STANDARDS, HAS THE MANDATE TO ENSURE THAT LABOR RIGHTS ARE A REALITY AT THE WORKPLACES) AND, THEREFORE, MORE LIKELY TO ENSURE AND ADVANCE THE PROMOTION AND ENFORCEMENT OF LEGAL PROVISIONS ON FORCED LABOR IN THIS AND OTHER SECTORS (SUCH AS SERICULTURE/SILK). TO THIS END, THE PROJECT WILL FURTHER STRENGTHEN THE SYSTEM OF LABOR INSPECTION AND THE CAPACITY OF LABOR INSPECTORS, AND WILL ALSO SUPPORT THE ALIGNMENT OF NATIONAL LEGISLATION AND PRACTICES ON LABOR INSPECTION WITH THE RELEVANT INTERNATIONAL LABOR STANDARDS, IN PARTICULAR WITH THE ILO LABOR INSPECTION CONVENTION, 1947 (NO. 81) AND ILO LABOR INSPECTION (AGRICULTURE) CONVENTION, 1969 (NO. 129).\n\nUNDER PHASE I, PERU AND NEPAL BECAME ALLIANCE 8.7 PATHFINDER COUNTRIES, WHILE UZBEKISTAN BECAME A PARTNER COUNTRY AND IS CONSIDERING BECOMING A PATHFINDER COUNTRY. THE PROJECT'S INTERVENTIONS IN ALL THREE COUNTRIES WILL CONTINUE TO SUPPORT THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THEIR PRIORITIES TO ACHIEVE SDG TARGET 8.7, IN LINE WITH THE PROJECT'S STRATEGY.\nTHE TWO NEW COUNTRIES THE ILO PROPOSES TO INCLUDE UNDER PHASE II ARE PAKISTAN AND MONGOLIA. NEITHER COUNTRY HAS RATIFIED PROTOCOL 29, AND BOTH HAVE REPEATEDLY REQUESTED TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE FROM THE ILO IN THE AREA OF FORCED LABOR. BOTH HAVE BEEN SUBJECT TO COMMENTS OR OBSERVATIONS BY THE COMMITTEE OF EXPERTS ON THE APPLICATION OF CONVENTIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS (CEACR) UNDER CONVENTION NO. 29 DURING THE PERIOD 2019-2020.\n\nSUBRECIPIENT ACTIVITIES\nN/A"}, {"date": "3/17/2025", "agency": "Department of Agriculture", "recipient": "Wisconsin Department of Agriculture, Trade and Consumer Protections", "value": 5489945, "savings": 5489945, "link": "https://usaspending.gov/award/ASST_NON_AM25LFPA0000C131_12K2", "description": "THE PURPOSE OF THIS AGREEMENT IS TO ALLOW STATE/TERRITORY AND FEDERALLY RECOGNIZED TRIBAL GOVERNMENTS TO EXPAND UPON PRIOR LOCAL FOOD PURCHASE ASSISTANCE PROGRAM WORK, AND TO PROVIDE AN OPPORTUNITY FOR STATE/TERRITORY AND FEDERALLY RECOGNIZED TRIBAL GOVERNMENTS WHO DID NOT PARTICIPATE IN THE LOCAL FOOD PURCHASE ASSISTANCE PROGRAM TO ESTABLISH PROJECTS THROUGH LFPA25.

HOWEVER, CHALLENGES REMAIN IN THE LABOR MARKET, PARTICULARLY CONCERNING INFORMAL EMPLOYMENT, LOW WAGES, AND ONGOING ISSUES SUCH AS CHILD AND FORCED LABOR. THE UNEMPLOYMENT RATE HAS FALLEN TO 7.4%, YET THESE POSITIVE TRENDS ARE OVERSHADOWED BY PERSISTENT LABOR VIOLATIONS AND OCCUPATIONAL SAFETY AND HEALTH (OSH) DEFICITS.BRAZIL IS RECOGNIZED INTERNATIONALLY FOR ITS EFFORTS TO COMBAT CHILD LABOR, HAVING RATIFIED KEY ILO CONVENTIONS AND INTEGRATED THEM INTO DOMESTIC LAW. HOWEVER, CHILD LABOR REMAINS A CRITICAL ISSUE, WITH 1.9 MILLION CHILDREN AND ADOLESCENTS ENGAGED IN WORK IN 2022, MANY INVOLVED IN HAZARDOUS ACTIVITIES PROHIBITED BY BRAZILIAN LAW AND PARTICULARLY AFFECTING GIRLS AND BLACK OR MIXED-RACE CHILDREN.FORCED LABOR CONTINUES TO BE A CONCERN, WITH OVER 63,000 WORKERS RESCUED SINCE 1995, AND A WORRYING INCREASE IN CASES IN 2023. THE MAJORITY OF THOSE EXPLOITED IN FORCED LABOR ARE MIXED-RACE MEN IN THE AGRICULTURAL SECTOR, OFTEN LACKING BASIC EDUCATION. THIS ISSUE HIGHLIGHTS THE URGENT NEED FOR IMPROVED LABOR INSPECTION AND ENFORCEMENT.SUPPLY CHAINS IN BRAZIL FACE SIGNIFICANT RISKS DUE TO THESE LABOR VIOLATIONS, WHICH THREATEN BOTH DOMESTIC INDUSTRIES AND INTERNATIONAL TRADE RELATIONS. WHILE BRAZIL HAS ESTABLISHED NATIONAL GUIDELINES ON BUSINESS AND HUMAN RIGHTS, CRITICISMS PERSIST REGARDING THE VOLUNTARY NATURE OF THESE REGULATIONS. TO ADDRESS THIS, NEW LEGISLATION IS BEING PROPOSED TO CREATE BINDING GUIDELINES FOR HUMAN RIGHTS IN BUSINESS ACTIVITIES.IN RESPONSE TO THESE CHALLENGES, THE BRAZILIAN GOVERNMENT, WITH SUPPORT FROM THE INTERNATIONAL LABOR ORGANIZATION (ILO) AND VARIOUS STAKEHOLDERS, HAS IMPLEMENTED A SERIES OF TRIPARTITE PACTS ( PACTOS ) AIMED AT IMPROVING WORKING CONDITIONS ACROSS SUPPLY CHAINS. THESE INITIATIVES, WHICH STARTED IN SECTORS SUCH AS WINE AND COFFEE, AIM TO PROMOTE DECENT WORK, FORMALIZE EMPLOYMENT, AND ERADICATE CHILD AND FORCED LABOR.THE ILO WILL COLLABORATE WITH THE BRAZILIAN GOVERNMENT AND OTHER STAKEHOLDERS TO ENHANCE THESE PACTS, FOCUSING ON BUILDING CAPACITY, FOSTERING SOCIAL DIALOGUE, AND INTEGRATING LOCAL VOICES INTO NATIONAL DECISION-MAKING PROCESSES. THE PROJECT WILL EMPHASIZE A SUPPLY CHAIN APPROACH TO ENSURE THE SUSTAINABILITY OF ITS INTERVENTIONS, TARGETING AT LEAST THREE SUPPLY CHAINS WITHIN BRAZIL S AGRICULTURAL SECTOR. KEY ACTIVITIES WILL INCLUDE ESTABLISHING A TECHNICAL SECRETARIAT TO OVERSEE THE PACTS, CONDUCTING ASSESSMENTS OF LABOR CONDITIONS, AND IMPLEMENTING TARGETED ACTIONS TO IMPROVE OSH STANDARDS AND ELIMINATE LABOR VIOLATIONS.THE PROJECT AIMS TO STRENGTHEN THE CAPACITY OF LABOR STAKEHOLDERS, INCLUDING THE MINISTRY OF LABOR AND EMPLOYMENT (MTE), TO ROBUSTLY IMPLEMENT THESE PACTS AND PROMOTE DECENT WORK. BY ENGAGING WITH CIVIL SOCIETY, LOCAL INSTITUTIONS, AND WORKERS  ORGANIZATIONS, THE PROJECT WILL ENSURE THAT THE NEEDS AND PERSPECTIVES OF VULNERABLE AND MARGINALIZED GROUPS ARE ADDRESSED. A PILOT PROJECT WILL ALSO BE DEVELOPED TO PROVIDE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE AND ENHANCE THE CAPACITY OF LOCAL GOVERNMENTS TO IMPLEMENT LABOR POLICIES, WITH THE POTENTIAL TO EXPAND SUCCESSFUL MODELS TO OTHER SUPPLY CHAINS.THIS COMPREHENSIVE APPROACH SEEKS TO CREATE SUSTAINABLE IMPROVEMENTS IN LABOR PRACTICES ACROSS BRAZIL, ALIGNING WITH GLOBAL STANDARDS AND CONTRIBUTING TO THE ERADICATION OF CHILD AND FORCED LABOR."}, {"date": "3/1/2025", "agency": "USAID", "recipient": "RTI INTERNATIONAL", "value": 34333376, "savings": 4998451, "link": "https://usaspending.gov/award/ASST_NON_72061720CA00007_7200", "description": "USAID/UGANDA BIODIVERSITY FOR RESILIENCE ACTIVITY"}, {"date": "3/1/2025", "agency": "USAID", "recipient": "FREEDOM HOUSE", "value": 8000000, "savings": 4994958, "link": "https://usaspending.gov/award/ASST_NON_7200AA24CA00008_7200", "description": "IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE PROGRAM DISCRIPTION."}, {"date": "2/13/2025", "agency": "Department Of Education", "recipient": "SOUTHERN EDUCATION FOUNDATION INC", "value": 8107355, "savings": 4990683.11, "link": "https://usaspending.gov/award/ASST_NON_S004D220011_9100", "description": "EAC REGION II--EAC SOUTH AT SOUTHERN EDUCATION FOUNDATION"}, {"date": "2/26/2025", "agency": "Department of State", "recipient": "FREEDOM HOUSE", "value": 4987388, "savings": 4987388, "link": null, "description": "Currently unavailable"}, {"date": "2/11/2025", "agency": "USAID", "recipient": "CONSORTIUM FOR ELECTIONS & POLITICAL PROCESS STRENGTHENING", "value": 14950000, "savings": 4980000, "link": "https://usaspending.gov/award/ASST_NON_72011522LA00001_7200", "description": "THE NEW ACTIVITY WILL SEEK TO STRENGTHEN DEMOCRATIC VALUES AND DEMOCRATIC CULTURE IN THE KYRGYZ REPUBLIC BY   BUILDING CONSTITUENT ENGAGEMENT IN POLITICAL PROCESSES AT LOCAL AND NATIONAL LEVELS AMONG WOMEN, YOUTH, AND   PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES ORGANIZATIONS; STRENGTHENING SOCIAL DISCOURSE ON DEMOCRACY AND ISSUES OF PUBLIC CONCERN   AND FOSTERING A NEW GENERATION OF DEMOCRATIC THINKERS."}, {"date": "2/26/2025", "agency": "Department of State", "recipient": "GENERAL SECRETARIAT OF THE ORGANIZATION OF AMERICAN STATES", "value": 4979989, "savings": 4979989, "link": "https://usaspending.gov/award/ASST_NON_SAQMIP25CA0014_1900", "description": "TO STRENGTHEN CHILE'S LABORATORY NETWORK TO MEET STEADY-STATE OPERATIONAL DEMANDS AND INTERNATIONAL REQUIREMENTS WHILE MAINTAINING CAPACITY AND AGILITY TO SURGE LABORATORY OPERATIONS DURING A BIOLOGICAL EVENT AND SUBSEQUENTLY SCALE DOWN AS APPROPRIATE."}, {"date": "3/23/2025", "agency": "Department of Health and Human Services", "recipient": "CT ST DEPT OF PUBLIC HEALTH", "value": 42846494, "savings": 4970322, "link": null, "description": "Currently unavailable"}, {"date": "3/1/2025", "agency": "USAID", "recipient": "FOIRN", "value": 6345000, "savings": 4970000, "link": "https://usaspending.gov/award/ASST_NON_72051224CA00004_7200", "description": "THE \u201cWELL-BEING AND TERRITORIAL MANAGEMENT IN THE RIO NEGRO AND XINGU RIVER BASINS\u201d ACTIVITY WILL STRENGTHEN THE CAPACITY OF INDIGENOUS PEOPLES OF THE XINGU AND RIO NEGRO RIVER BASINS AND THEIR NETWORKS OF PARTNERSHIPS TO IMPLEMENT BRAZIL\u2019S NATIONAL POLICY FOR THE TERRITORIAL AND ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT OF INDIGENOUS LANDS (PNGATI) AND ITS MANAGEMENT INSTRUMENTS, SUCH AS THE TERRITORIAL AND ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT PLANS (PGTAS).

WANIHA ANTICIPATES 1,250 TOTAL DIRECT PARTICIPANTS, BUT THIS WILL BE FINALIZED DURING THE SIX-MONTH STAKEHOLDER ENGAGEMENT AND STRATEGY VALIDATION PERIOD. WE ARE REQUESTING $4 MILLION USD OVER 54 MONTHS.3) ACTIVITIES TO BE PERFORMED: OUR STRATEGY EMPLOYS MULTI-SECTORAL APPROACHES AND ACTIVITIES TO EMPOWER LOCAL STAKEHOLDERS, STRENGTHEN GOVERNANCE SYSTEMS, AND ENHANCE TRACKING AND REPORTING CAPACITIES AT ALL LEVELS. THESE APPROACHES AND ACTIVITIES INCLUDE: 1) IMPROVE DATA COLLECTION AT THE NATIONAL AND LOCAL LEVEL TO PROVIDE ACCURATE, DISAGGREGATED DATA ON CL AND ACW IN ASGM. THIS WILL INCLUDE TRAINING LOCAL AUTHORITIES AND CIVIL SOCIETY ORGANIZATIONS (CSOS) TO USE UPDATED DATA COLLECTION TOOLS AND INTEGRATE NEW ASGM-SPECIFIC METRICS INTO NATIONAL SYSTEMS, SUCH AS THE NATIONAL INTEGRATED CASE MANAGEMENT SYSTEM (NICMS). 2) STRENGTHEN GOVERNANCE STRUCTURES BY IMPROVING COORDINATION BETWEEN LOCAL GOVERNMENT, MINING COMMUNITIES, AND NATIONAL SYSTEMS. THIS WILL INCLUDE JOINT MONITORING VISITS, INSPECTIONS, AND CREATING BYLAWS TO SUPPORT BETTER DATA SHARING AND ENFORCEMENT. 3) TRAIN LOCAL GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS, MINING WORKERS, AND COMMUNITY LEADERS ON CL LAWS, SAFE MINING PRACTICES, AND THE USE OF MERCURY  WHILE STRENGTHENING THE CAPACITY OF LOCAL AUTHORITIES, CSOS, AND COMMUNITY ORGANIZATIONS TO MONITOR, IDENTIFY, AND REPORT INSTANCES OF CL AND ACW VIOLATIONS IN ASGM, AND ADDRESS CL AND ACW THROUGH AWARENESS-RAISING CAMPAIGNS AND COMMUNITY-DRIVEN PILOTS.4) EXPECTED OUTCOMES: OUTCOME 1: INCREASED CAPACITY OF KEY STAKEHOLDERS TO COLLECT AND DISSEMINATE DATA ON CL AND ACW IN ASGM. OUTCOME 2: INCREASED MONITORING, IDENTIFICATION, AND REPORTING OF CL AND ACW IN ASGM. OUTCOME 3: INCREASED CAPACITY OF KEY STAKEHOLDERS TO ADDRESS CL AND PROMOTE ACW AND ASGM AT THE LOCAL LEVEL.5) INTENDED BENEFICIARIES: AN ESTIMATED 6,0001 DIRECT AND INDIRECT PARTICIPANTS, INCLUDING WOMEN MINERS, MINING COMMUNITIES, LOCAL GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS, AND CSOS WILL BE REACHED THROUGH CAPACITY STRENGTHENING, RESEARCH, WORKSHOPS, AND TRAINING ACTIVITIES ASSOCIATED WITH HAZARDOUS WORK IN THE ASGM SECTOR.6) SUBRECIPIENT ACTIVITIES: WANIHA WILL BE IMPLEMENTED IN PARTNERSHIP WITH TWO LOCAL ORGANIZATIONS, RAFIKI SOCIAL DEVELOPMENT ORGANIZATION (RAFIKI SDO) AND TANZANIA WOMEN MINERS ASSOCIATION (TAWOMA), WITH WHOM PACT HAS PREVIOUSLY COLLABORATED. RAFIKI SDO WILL BE THE MAIN TECHNICAL PARTNER FOR OUTCOME 2, IMPLEMENTING A CASCADE TRAINING APPROACH FOR COMMUNITY-FACING FRONTLINE WORKERS WHO IDENTIFY, MONITOR, AND REPORT ON CL AND ACW. TAWOMA WILL LEAD ADVOCACY AND COORDINATION ACTIVITIES UNDER OUTCOME 2 AND IMPLEMENT LIVELIHOODS STRENGTHENING ACTIVITIES UNDER OUTCOME 3. BOTH PARTNERS WILL BE INVOLVED IN IMPLEMENTING COMMUNITY-LED MONITORING, ECONOMIC, AND EDUCATIONAL INITIATIVES TO REDUCE CHILD LABOR IN GEITA. OUR WORK WITH THESE PARTNERS WILL BUILD LONG-TERM CAPACITY AND SUSTAINABILITY, GRADUALLY TRANSFERRING LEADERSHIP AND ENSURING COMMUNITY COHESION AND SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT THROUGH INTEGRATED ACTIVITIES AND CROSS-SECTORAL ENGAGEMENT."}, {"date": "3/1/2025", "agency": "USAID", "recipient": "EDUCATION DEVELOPMENT CENTER, INC.", "value": 5000000, "savings": 3935620, "link": "https://usaspending.gov/award/ASST_NON_72060824CA00001_7200", "description": "STRENGTHEN THE MEASUREMENT AND ASSESS THE IMPACT OF YOUTH AND COUNTERING VIOLENT EXTREMISM PROGRAMS AND INTERVENTIONS IN MOROCCO TO IMPROVE PROGRAM DESIGN, IMPLEMENTATION, AND DECISION-MAKING."}, {"date": "3/26/2025", "agency": "Department of Labor", "recipient": "International Labor Organization (ILO)", "value": 5000000, "savings": 3935267, "link": "https://usaspending.gov/award/ASST_NON_23K75IL000002_1605", "description": "THE INTERNATIONAL LABOUR ORGANIZATION PROPOSES TO CARRY OUT THE OBSERVATION AND ENGAGEMENT FOR FREEDOM OF ASSOCIATION AND COLLECTIVE BARGAINING RIGHTS REALIZATION (OBSERVAR) INITIATIVE.THE IMPLEMENTATION OF MEXICOS LABOUR REFORMS OF 2017 AND 2019, ACCOMPANIED BY THE RATIFICATION OF THE RIGHT TO ORGANISE AND COLLECTIVE BARGAINING CONVENTION, 1949 (NO. 98), SET THE GROUNDS TO ADDRESS ILO SUPERVISORY BODIES COMMENTS ON THE APPLICATION OF CONVENTION NO. 87 AND OVERALL PRINCIPLES OF FREEDOM OF ASSOCIATION AND THE EFFECTIVE RECOGNITION OF THE RIGHT TO COLLECTIVE BARGAINING IN THE COUNTRY.

THE PROJECT WILL ENSURE THAT 60 % OF BENEFICIARIES ARE AGYW. IT WILL ADDRESS THE NEEDS OF OVCA&Y AND THEIR PRIMARY CAREGIVERS BY ACHIEVING THE FOLLOWING OBJECTIVES:  OBJECTIVE 1 (HEALTHY): THE FIRST OBJECTIVE IS TO IMPROVE OVCA&Y ACCESS TO SEXUAL REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH AND HIV CARE AND PREVENTIVE SERVICES THROUGH RELATED SMALL GROUP EVIDENCE-BASED INTERVENTIONS, FACILITATING ACCESS TO HTS (OFFERED DIRECTLY AT HOME AND THROUGH PARTNER FACILITIES) AND SUCCESSFUL LINKAGES TO ANTI-RETROVIRAL THERAPY, CONTRACEPTIVES AND OTHER HEALTH SERVICES. IT WILL ALSO PROVIDE PSYCHOSOCIAL AND PSYCHOLOGICAL SUPPORT TO INFECTED, BEREAVED OVCA&Y OR VICTIMS OF ABUSE.  OBJECTIVE 2 (SAFE): THE SECOND OBJECTIVE IS TO IMPROVE CHILD PROTECTION AND PREVENTION OF GENDER BASED VIOLENCE (GBV) THROUGH DIRECT SUPPORT TO OVCA&Y, THEIR PRIMARY CAREGIVERS AND THE COMMUNITY. CINDI WILL PROVIDE CHILD PROTECTION EDUCATION AND PARENTING SKILLS TRAINING FOR CAREGIVERS, AND TRAINED PROJECT PERSONNEL WILL BE ABLE TO DETECT AND INITIATE REMOVAL OF CHILDREN FROM ABUSIVE ENVIRONMENTS.   OBJECTIVE 3 (STABLE): THE THIRD OBJECTIVE IS TO IMPROVE HOUSEHOLD ECONOMIC SECURITY AND LINKAGE TO SOCIAL PROTECTION THROUGH PROVISION OF TRAINING AND SUPPORT TO BOTH OVCA&Y AND THEIR PRIMARY CAREGIVERS. CINDI WILL PREPARE ADOLESCENTS AND YOUTH FOR SELF-EMPLOYMENT OR THE JOB MARKET THROUGH FINANCIAL CAPABILITY, ENTREPRENEURSHIP AND EMPLOYABILITY TRAINING (ASPIRES).  CAREGIVERS WILL RECEIVE SUPPORT TO ACCESS SOCIAL GRANTS AND BE ENROLLED IN SAVINGS GROUPS TO INCREASE FAMILY INCOME.  OBJECTIVE 4 (SCHOOLED): THE FOURTH OBJECTIVE IS TO IMPROVE SCHOOL RETENTION AND PROGRESSION AND EARLY CHILDHOOD DEVELOPMENT. CINDI WILL DO THIS THROUGH THE PROVISION OF HOMEWORK SUPPORT AND TUITION CLUBS TO IDENTIFIED LEARNERS, PROVISION OF SCHOOL UNIFORMS, STATIONERY AND DISTRIBUTION OF SANITARY PADS TO MINIMIZE ABSENTEEISM. THROUGH HOME VISITS OUT OF SCHOOL YOUTHS WILL BE LINKED TO TERTIARY EDUCATION. CAREGIVERS WILL BE PROVIDED WITH HOUSEHOLD STIMULATING ECD PROGRAMS AND WILL ALSO BE PROVIDED WITH MATERIAL SUPPORT SUCH AS CLOTHES, TOYS AND STATIONERY TO ENHANCE ECD.  1.3 THEORY OF CHANGE   THE PROJECT AIMS TO IMPROVE THE WELL-BEING OF OVCA&Y THE THROUGH EVIDENCE-BASED HIV PREVENTION AND SRH EDUCATION, HIV TESTING SERVICES, CHILD PROTECTION, CLINICAL NUTRITIONAL SUPPORT, GENERAL HEALTHCARE REFERRAL, HEALTHCARE SUPPORT FOR ACCESS TO ANTI-RETROVIRAL TREATMENT, EDUCATIONAL SUPPORT, PSYCHOLOGICAL CARE AND HOUSEHOLD ECONOMIC STRENGTHENING.  CINDI HAS BEEN IMPLEMENTING AN OVCA&Y PROJECT SINCE OCTOBER 2007. THE PROJECT HAS USED THE LESSONS LEARNT AND APPLIES BEST PRACTICES TO IMPROVE OVCA&Y PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION IN SUBSEQUENT YEARS. FOR EXAMPLE: INCREASED ACCESS THROUGH HOME BASED TESTING; PROVIDING CONSISTENT STRUCTURED EVIDENCE BASED INTERVENTIONS ACROSS PARTNERS TO ENHANCE QUALITY SERVICE DELIVERY; FOCUS ON BUILDING THE CAPACITY OF PARENTS WITH NOT JUST ECONOMIC SUPPORT BUT EDUCATION AND ENGAGING THEM IN THE HIV PREVENTION INTERVENTIONS; STRONG CULTURAL TABOOS FOR PARENT-CHILD SEXUAL HEALTH COMMUNICATION CAN BE OVERCOME WITH TRAINED FACILITATORS AND EVIDENCE INFORMED AND CULTURALLY SENSITIVE CURRICULUMS.

THE PREVALENCE OF INFORMALITY AND UNSTABLE AND TEMPORARY EMPLOYMENT RELATIONSHIPS THAT CHARACTERIZE THE SECTOR, ALONG WITH OTHER FACTORS SUCH AS REMOTE AND ISOLATED WORK AND LIVING ENVIRONMENTS, LOW LITERACY LEVELS AND LACK OF AWARENESS AND UNDERSTANDING ABOUT RIGHTS AMONG WORKERS, INCREASE THE RISK OF EXPLOITATION AND FORCED LABOUR.

THE RECENT CIVIL UNREST AND THE SUBSEQUENT CHANGES IN THE GOVERNMENT ADMINISTRATION IN AUGUST 2024, HAS UNDERSCORED THE PRESSING NEED FOR POLITICAL AND ECONOMIC REFORMS. THE FORMATION OF AN INTERIM GOVERNMENT PRESENTS BOTH CHALLENGES AND OPPORTUNITIES TO ADDRESS LONGSTANDING ISSUES WITH WORKERS RIGHTS AND LABOR ISSUES. THE SUCCESS OF BANGLADESHS TRANSITION WILL LARGELY DEPEND ON SUSTAINABLE GROWTH, INCLUSIVE HUMAN DEVELOPMENT, AND, CRUCIALLY, THE PRIORITIZATION OF LABOR REFORMS ALIGNED WITH INTERNATIONAL LABOR STANDARDS (ILS). EMPOWERING TRADE UNIONS TO EFFECTIVELY SAFEGUARD WORKERS  RIGHTS IS CRITICAL IN ENSURING A JUST AND EQUITABLE LABOR MARKET. THE READY-MADE GARMENTS (RMG) SECTOR PLAYS A VITAL ROLE IN THIS REGARD, AS IT IS THE LARGEST FORMAL SECTOR OF EMPLOYMENT, WITH AROUND 4 MILLION WORKERS, AND CONTRIBUTED 10.35% OF GDP IN 2023.DESPITE NOTABLE PROGRESS IN WORKING CONDITIONS SINCE THE RANA PLAZA TRAGEDY, BANGLADESH CONTINUES TO FACE SIGNIFICANT CHALLENGES IN LABOR MARKET GOVERNANCE. THESE CHALLENGES INCLUDE WEAK LEGISLATIVE FRAMEWORKS, INEFFECTIVE LABOR INSPECTION SYSTEMS, AND LIMITATIONS ON FREEDOM OF ASSOCIATION (FOA) AND COLLECTIVE BARGAINING (CB) RIGHTS. THE SITUATION IS FURTHER EXACERBATED BY INSUFFICIENT TRIPARTISM, GENDER DISPARITIES IN LABOR FORCE PARTICIPATION, AND LOW TRADE UNION DENSITY (11.9%), ALL OF WHICH UNDERMINE BANGLADESH S GLOBAL COMPETITIVENESS AND RISK THE LOSS OF PREFERENTIAL MARKET ACCESS POST LDC GRADUATION. IN ADDITION, THE LACK OF REGULAR DATA ON THE TRADE UNION DENSITY AND COLLECTIVE BARGAINING COVERAGE IS A KEY CONSTRAINT IN UNDERSTANDING THE OVERALL SITUATION OF FOA AND CB RIGHTS IN THE COUNTRY BASED ON SUCH QUANTITATIVE EVIDENCE AND BUILDING UP CAPACITY IN THIS REGARD WOULD BE CRUCIAL FOR THE FUTURE.THE URGENCY OF ADDRESSING THESE ISSUES IS FURTHER HIGHLIGHTED BY THE ONGOING ARTICLE 26 COMPLAINT OF NON-OBSERVANCE OF RATIFIED ILO CONVENTIONS0F1, RAISED BY WORKER DELEGATES AT THE INTERNATIONAL LABOR CONFERENCE IN 2019. THIS COMPLAINT PROMPTED THE GOVERNMENT OF BANGLADESH (GOB) TO COMMIT TO A SERIES OF LABOR SECTOR REFORMS THROUGH THE ILO GOVERNING BODY (GB) ROADMAP (2021-2026) AND THE NATIONAL ACTION PLAN (NAP) FOR THE LABOR SECTOR (2021-2026).THE PROJECT IS A CRITICAL COMPONENT OF A BROADER, COORDINATED EFFORT BY THE ILO, THE GOB, AND WORKERS  AND EMPLOYERS  ORGANIZATIONS TO PROMOTE DECENT WORK IN BANGLADESH. THE PROJECT WILL CONTRIBUTE TO IMPROVING OVERALL WORKING CONDITIONS AND SOCIAL DIALOGUE MECHANISMS FOR WORKERS IN GARMENT FACTORIES THROUGH BETTER WORKS FACTORY ENGAGEMENT MODEL, WHICH INCLUDES ASSESSMENT, ADVISORY, AND TRAINING SERVICES. THE PROJECT AIMS TO CAPACITATE ENTERPRISE-LEVEL TRADE UNIONS IN BETTER WORK-REGISTERED FACTORIES TO ENSURE THEIR EFFECTIVE OPERATIONS AND ESTABLISH AN ENABLING ENVIRONMENT FOR IMPROVED FOA AND CB. WORKING IN TANDEM WITH BROADER ILO INITIATIVES, BETTER WORK WILL USE THE KNOWLEDGE AND EVIDENCE GENERATED FROM THIS PROJECT TO STRENGTHEN SOUND INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS AT THE SECTORAL AND NATIONAL LEVELS. THE OUTCOMES OF THE PROJECT WILL PROVIDE 4VALUABLE EXPERIENCE AND RESULTS THAT CAN IDEALLY BE REPLICATED ACROSS OTHER INDUSTRIAL SECTORS IN BANGLADESH, FURTHER ENHANCING THE OVERALL IMPACT OF THESE EFFORTS.THIS PROJECT CONTRIBUTES TO BETTER WORK BANGLADESHS ONGOING EFFORTS TO ENSURE RESPONSIBLE BUSINESS CONDUCT, RESPECTFUL OF INTERNATIONALLY RECOGNISED HUMAN RIGHTS, AND ALIGNING ITS EFFORTS WITH THE ILOS WORK TO PROMOTE THE UN GUIDING PRINCIPLES ON BUSINESS AND HUMAN RIGHTS (UNGPS) AND THE ILOS MNE DECLARATION.ALIGNED WITH NATIONAL AND INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT FRAMEWORKS, INCLUDING THE 8TH FIVE YEAR PLAN (FYP) AND THE UN SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT COOPERATION FRAMEWORK (2022-2026), THE PROJECT CONTRIBUTES TO THE PURSUIT OF THE SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT GOALS (SDGS) BY 2030."}, {"date": "2/26/2025", "agency": "Department of State", "recipient": "ADVOCATES FOR HUMAN RIGHTS", "value": 999999, "savings": 999999, "link": null, "description": "Currently unavailable"}, {"date": "3/1/2025", "agency": "USAID", "recipient": "BRIGHAM & WOMENS HOSPITAL INC", "value": 1499998, "savings": 999998, "link": "https://usaspending.gov/award/ASST_NON_72044024CA00002_7200", "description": "USAID ADVANCING MEDICAL LICENSING ACTIVITY IN VIET NAM"}, {"date": "2/26/2025", "agency": "Department of State", "recipient": "INTERNEWS UKRAINE", "value": 999962.04, "savings": 999962.04, "link": null, "description": "Currently unavailable"}, {"date": "2/26/2025", "agency": "Department of State", "recipient": "M&C SAATCHI WORLD SERVICES LLP", "value": 999172, "savings": 999172, "link": null, "description": "Currently unavailable"}, {"date": "2/27/2025", "agency": "Department of State", "recipient": "EAST-WEST MANAGEMENT INSTITUTE INC", "value": 1000000, "savings": 999109, "link": null, "description": "Currently unavailable"}, {"date": "3/23/2025", "agency": "Department of Health and Human Services", "recipient": "INDIANA STATE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH", "value": 998977, "savings": 998977, "link": null, "description": "Currently unavailable"}, {"date": "3/23/2025", "agency": "Department of Health and Human Services", "recipient": "WEST VIRGINIA STATE HEALTH DEPARTMENT", "value": 3230602, "savings": 997261, "link": null, "description": "Currently unavailable"}, {"date": "3/23/2025", "agency": "Department of Health and Human Services", "recipient": "LA ST DEPT OF HLTH & HOSPITALS, OFFICE OF PUBLIC HEALTH", "value": 190781430, "savings": 996725, "link": null, "description": "Currently unavailable"}, {"date": "3/23/2025", "agency": "Department of Health and Human Services", "recipient": "AZ ST DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH SERVICES", "value": 3364463, "savings": 996701, "link": null, "description": "Currently unavailable"}, {"date": "3/23/2025", "agency": "Department of Health and Human Services", "recipient": "GUAM BEHAVIORAL HEALTH AND WELLNESS CENTER", "value": 3000000, "savings": 996562, "link": null, "description": "Currently unavailable"}, {"date": "2/26/2025", "agency": "Department of State", "recipient": "PAMS Foundation", "value": 994991.32, "savings": 994991.32, "link": "https://usaspending.gov/award/ASST_NON_SINLEC24GR0225_1900", "description": "THE PURPOSE OF THIS AWARD IS TO ADDRESS THE COMPLEX ENVIRONMENTAL, ECONOMIC, AND SECURITY CHALLENGES IN TANZANIA THROUGH A COMPREHENSIVE, MULTI-FACETED APPROACH.

(RMG, TEA, SHRIMP FARMING, AND CONSTRUCTION) IN THREE GEOGRAPHIC AREAS (SYLHET, KHULNA AND DHAKA) BY BUILDING THE CAPACITY OF WORKERS TO IDENTIFY AND COLLECTIVELY SEEK REMEDIATION FOR OCCUPATIONAL SAFETY AND HEALTH ISSUES, INCLUDING GBVH, AND TO ADVOCATE FOR SAFER, HEALTHIER AND MORE EQUITABLE WORKPLACES AND SURROUNDING COMMUNITIES. WHILE THERE IS NOT A CATALYZING CATASTROPHIC EVENT TO DRAW ATTENTION TO THE LABOR CONDITIONS IN TEA, SHRIMP FARMING AND CONSTRUCTION SECTORS AS THERE WAS IN THE RMG SECTOR, THE SLOW ONSET EFFECTS OF CLIMATE CHANGE THAT EXACERBATE EXISTING OSH CONCERNS SHOULD RAISE SIMILAR ALARM. THEREFORE, THE PROGRAM WILL ALSO TAKE INTO ACCOUNT THE IMPACTS OF CLIMATE CHANGE AND ENVIRONMENTAL DEGRADATION ON WORKERS AND THEIR COMMUNITIES. THE DESIGN ALSO RECOGNIZES THAT THOUGH INDUSTRIAL ACCIDENTS AND FIRES ARE THE MOST VISIBLE OSH HAZARDS, LESS WIDELY DISCUSSED INDUSTRIAL HEALTH ISSUES CAN HAVE LONG-TERM NEGATIVE IMPACTS ON WORKERS, FAMILIES AND COMMUNITIES. COMMON OCCUPATIONAL DISEASES IN THE FOUR TARGET SECTORS INCLUDE MUSCULOSKELETAL DISORDERS, PESTICIDE POISONING, HEAT EXHAUSTION, RESPIRATORY ILLNESS, REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH ISSUES, AND CANCER. IT IS ESSENTIAL TO ADDRESS THESE SAFETY AND HEALTH CONCERNS HOLISTICALLY.  THE SC WILL UTILIZE A WHOLE-OF-COMMUNITY APPROACH (AS EFFECTIVELY PILOTED BY THE SC IN THE RMG, SHRIMP AND FISH PROCESSING, AND LEATHER TANNERIES SECTORS) TO ENGAGE WORKERS, THEIR UNIONS, COMMUNITY MEMBERS AND COMMUNITY-BASED ORGANIZATIONS IN JOINT INITIATIVES FOR IMPROVING WORKING AND LIVING CONDITIONS IN THE SELECTED AREAS. THIS WILL INCLUDE COMMUNITY-BASED INTERVENTIONS, TAILORED TO EACH SECTOR, WHERE PROJECT PARTICIPANTS CAN PARTICIPATE IN TRAINING, SEEK LEGAL COUNSEL OR HEALTH SERVICES, AND HOLD ORGANIZING AND ADVOCACY MEETINGS TO ADVANCE THEIR SHARED GOALS. THE APPROACH RECOGNIZES THAT WORKERS' LIVES EXTEND BEYOND THE FACTORY OR FARM GATE AND THAT WORKPLACE AND PUBLIC HEALTH OVERLAP IN TANGIBLE WAYS.\n\n\nACTIVITIES PERFORMED\nDURING THE THREE-TO-SIX-MONTH START-UP PERIOD, THE SC AND PARTNER ORGANIZATIONS WILL CONDUCT INITIAL NEEDS ASSESSMENTS IN EACH SECTOR (FOUR TOTAL) THAT WILL INCLUDE THE LEADERSHIP OF PARTNER ORGANIZATIONS, WORKER-LEADERS FROM THE TARGET SECTORS, RELEVANT SC STAFF, AND THE PROJECT DIRECTOR. DUE TO THE SIZE AND COMPLEXITY OF THE SHRIMP FARMING AND TEA SECTORS, THE NEEDS ASSESSMENT WILL REQUIRE 3 DAYS. SINCE THE SCALE OF PROJECT ACTIVITIES PLANNED FOR THE CONSTRUCTION SECTOR IS RELATIVELY LESS, THE ASSESSMENT WILL REQUIRE ONLY 2 DAYS. LIKEWISE, AS THE SC HAS BEEN IMPLEMENTING PROGRAMS IN THE RMG SECTOR FOR DECADES, ONLY 1 DAY IS NEEDED. THE ASSESSMENTS WILL INCLUDE PARTICIPATORY ANALYSIS OF THE SECTOR; KEY LOCAL, NATIONAL, AND INTERNATIONAL ALLIES AND DECISION-MAKERS; UNIQUE NEEDS OF MARGINALIZED WORKER GROUPS IN THE PRODUCTION SYSTEMS, PARTICULARLY RELATED TO OSH AND GBVH; AND RELEVANT CONDITIONS CONTRIBUTING TO AND PERPETUATING THE PROBLEMS. FOR CONSTRUCTION, SHRIMP FARMING AND TEA, WHICH ARE NEW SECTORS OF WORK, THE ASSESSMENT WILL INCLUDE IN-DEPTH ANALYSIS OF THE GEOGRAPHIC AREAS TO DETERMINE THE SPECIFIC COMMUNITIES AND WORKPLACES WHERE THE PROGRAM HAS BOTH ACCESS AND POTENTIAL FOR THE GREATEST IMPACT. IN EACH ASSESSMENT, FACILITATORS WILL LEAD ANALYSIS OF THE ROOT CAUSES OF DISPARITIES AND INEQUITIES THAT WORKERS FROM MARGINALIZED GROUPS FACE. FACILITATORS WILL USE POPULAR EDUCATION TECHNIQUES TO ELICIT CONTRIBUTIONS FROM THE PARTICIPANTS, APPLYING AN INTERSECTIONAL GENDER ANALYSIS TO IDENTIFY SPECIFIC NEEDS ARISING FROM THE EXPERIENCE OF WOMEN, GENDER DIVERSE INDIVIDUALS, AND ETHNIC AND RELIGIOUS MINORITIES IN THE PROJECT SECTORS. DURING SENSITIVE CONVERSATIONS ABOUT GENDER EQUALITY AND GBVH, FACILITATORS WILL DIVIDE FOCUS GROUPS BY SEX TO CREATE AN ENVIRONMENT WHERE PARTICIPANTS FEEL SAFE AND COMFORTABLE TO SHARE. THE INITIAL ASSESSMENT WILL IDENTIFY ANY THREATS TO SAFETY FOR ORGANIZATIONS AND WORKERS TAKING PART IN THE PROJECT, INCLUDING AN ANALYSIS OF THE POSSIBLE ORIGINS OF THE THREATS, THE DIFFERENTIATED IMPACTS ON MEN AND WOMEN, AND THE RESOURCES AVAILABLE TO MINIMIZE THE POSSIBILITY OF NEGATIVE IMPACTS. THE ASSESSMENT SESSIONS WILL INCLUDE PARTICIPATORY STRATEGIC PLANNING FOR PROJECT INTERVENTIONS, DEVELOP SUSTAINABILITY PLANS, AND BUILD DETAILED YEAR 1 WORK PLANS.\n\nDELIVERABLES\nTHE PROJECT ENVISIONS AN APPROACH TO STRENGTHEN WORKER ORGANIZATIONS AND IMPROVE WORKER KNOWLEDGE AROUND OSH AND GBVH. CENTRAL TO THIS STRATEGY WILL BE INCLUSION OF WOMEN WORKERS, WHO MAKE UP THE MAJORITY OF THE RMG, SHRIMP FARMING AND TEA WORKFORCE, AND ON THE OPPOSITE SIDE OF THE SPECTRUM, THE EXTREME MINORITY OF THE CONSTRUCTION SECTOR. THE STRATEGY IS ARTICULATED IN 6 PARTS, WHICH CORRESPOND TO THE PROJECT SUB-OUTCOMES:\n1. EDUCATE: THE INCREASED CAPACITY OF WORKERS AND THEIR ORGANIZATIONS TO TRAIN ON PROMOTING SAFER, HEALTHIER, AND MORE EQUITABLE WORKPLACES AND COMMUNITIES WILL IMPROVE THE EFFECTIVENESS OF WORKER ORGANIZATIONS IN EDUCATING AND ENGAGING THEIR MEMBERSHIP. THE SC WILL PRIORITIZE OSH AND LABOR RIGHTS TRAINING-OF-TRAINERS (TOT) IN ALL SECTORS TO STRENGTHEN THE CAPACITY OF PARTNER ORGANIZATIONS TO TRAIN WORKERS ON THEIR RIGHTS.\n2. REPRESENT: BY BUILDING THE CAPACITY OF WORKER ORGANIZATIONS TO REPRESENT MEMBERS TO PROMOTE SAFER, HEALTHIER, AND MORE EQUITABLE WORKPLACES AND COMMUNITIES, INSTITUTIONS AND INDIVIDUALS WILL BE BETTER EQUIPPED TO TAKE UP WORKER PRIORITIES AND COLLECTIVELY DELIVER REAL CHANGE IN LIVING AND WORKING CONDITIONS. ACROSS THE FOUR SECTORS, THE SC WILL UTILIZE A MENU OF SAFETY COMMITTEE TRAININGS, GENDER EQUALITY AND GBVH TRAININGS, PARALEGAL CAPACITY BUILDING, AND LEGAL SUPPORT TO ADVANCE THIS STRATEGY.\n3. ADVOCATE: THE INCREASED CAPACITY OF WORKERS, COMMUNITY MEMBERS AND THEIR ORGANIZATIONS TO ADVOCATE FOR SAFER, HEALTHIER AND MORE EQUITABLE WORKPLACES AND COMMUNITIES WILL BE CRITICAL TO STRENGTHENING WORKER ORGANIZATIONS AND ADDRESSING OSH AND GBVH ISSUES IN THE TARGET SECTORS. IN CONSULTATION WITH PARTNERS, THE SC WILL UTILIZE A VARIETY OF MEDIUMS (DIGITAL, PRINT, AUDIO, ETC.) AND VENUES (CULTURAL CELEBRATIONS, COMMUNITY HEALTH CAMPS, ETC.) TO MAKE ADVOCACY CAMPAIGNS MORE ACCESSIBLE AND INCLUSIVE, WHICH IN TURN, INCREASES BUY-IN AND MAKES THEM MORE POWERFUL.\n4. ENGAGE: THE INCREASED ENGAGEMENT OF WORKERS AND THEIR ORGANIZATIONS IN LAW AND POLICY DEVELOPMENT AND IMPLEMENTATION IS KEY TO IMPROVING WORKER ORGANIZATIONS' ABILITY TO ADDRESS AND RESOLVE WORKERS' CONCERNS. TO SUPPORT PARTNERS IN THIS AREA, THE SC WILL CONDUCT AN OSH LEGAL AND POLICY GAP ANALYSIS, CONDUCT MULTI-STAKEHOLDER MEETINGS, AND INITIATE ENGAGEMENT WITH THE NATIONAL OSH COUNCIL.\n5. NEGOTIATE: THE STRENGTHENED CAPACITY OF WORKERS TO NEGOTIATE WITH EMPLOYERS ON WORKER RIGHTS ISSUES, INCLUDING OSH AND GBVH, IS NECESSARY TO ADDRESS AND RESOLVE WORKER'S RIGHTS CONCERNS, INCLUDING OSH CONDITIONS AND GBVH. TO THAT END, THE SC WILL CONDUCT JOINT MANAGEMENT AND WORKER TRAININGS AND COLLECTIVE BARGAINING MENTORING. ALL STEPS WILL BE ACCOMPANIED BY BROADER UNION CAPACITY BUILDING, WHICH IS FUNDAMENTAL TO SUSTAINING THEIR ABILITY TO PROTECT AND REPRESENT WORKERS ON LABOR RIGHTS ISSUES, PARTICULARLY OSH AND GBVH.\n\nINTENDED BENEFICIARY\nIN BANGLADESH, THE TARGET WORKER POPULATION WILL INCLUDE MEN AND WOMEN WORKERS FROM THE RMG, SHRIMP FARMING, CONSTRUCTION, AND TEA SECTORS. THE MAJORITY OF RMG WORKERS ARE WOMEN, MANY OF WHOM ARE INTERNAL MIGRANTS. SHRIMP FARMERS IN KHULNA ARE MAJORITY WOMEN DAY LABORERS WORKING AT UNREGISTERED FARMS. THE TEA WORKERS ARE BASED IN THE SYLHET AREA AND ARE ALSO MAJORITY WOMEN WORKERS. THROUGH THIS PROJECT, THE SC WILL TARGET CONSTRUCTION WORKERS IN THE DHAKA DIVISION, THE GREAT MAJORITY OF WHOM ARE MEN IN THE INFORMAL ECONOMY.\n\nSUBRECIPIENT ACTIVITIES\nTARGET WORKER AND NON-GOVERNMENTAL ORGANIZATIONS FOR CAPACITY BUILDING AND STRENGTHENING INCLUDE BANGLADESH CHA SRAMIK UNION (BCSU), IMARAT NIRMAN SRAMIK UNION BANGLADESH (INSUB), AND RURAL AND URBAN POOR'S PARTNER FOR SOCIAL ADVANCEMENT (RUPSA).\nBCSU HAS PLAYED AN IMPORTANT ROLE IN REPRESENTING TEA WORKERS SINCE ITS FOUNDING IN 1948. THE UNION IS THE LARGEST NATIONAL LABOR UNION IN BANGLADESH AND REPRESENTS MORE THAN 100,000 WORKERS OF WHICH TWO-THIRDS ARE WOMEN AND GIRLS IN THE CHITTAGONG AND SYLHET REGION. BCSU HAS STRONG ORGANIZATIONAL CAPACITY, A SECTORAL CBA THAT IS UP FOR RENEWAL, AND AN UNDERSTANDING OF THE IMPACT OF POOR OSH AND LABOR RIGHTS CONDITIONS IN THE TEA SECTOR. INSUB IS AN INDEPENDENT NATIONAL TRADE UNION REPRESENTING OVER 60,000 WORKERS IN THE CONSTRUCTION SECTOR IN BANGLADESH. INSUB HAS A STRONG HISTORY OF ADVOCATING FOR THE IMPLEMENTATION OF WORKER RIGHTS, INCLUDING LIVING WAGES AND SAFE WORKING CONDITIONS. INSUB IS ALSO AN ACTIVE AFFILIATE OF THE BANGLADESH TRADE UNION CENTER, WHICH IS A NATIONAL LEVEL FEDERATION.\nRUPSA IS A GRASSROOTS NGO REGISTERED IN 1994 AND BASED IN KHULNA, WORKING TO DEVELOP SOCIAL, CULTURAL, ECONOMIC, AND ENVIRONMENTAL CONDITIONS TO IMPROVE LIVELIHOODS OF COASTAL COMMUNITIES. RUPSA IS IMPLEMENTING ACTIVITIES IN THE KHULNA DISTRICT OF BANGLADESH IN THE FOLLOWING AREAS: WORKERS' RIGHTS, HEALTH AND HYGIENE, MANGROVE REFORESTATION, LIVELIHOOD DEVELOPMENT, AND TRANSGENDER COMMUNITY LIVELIHOOD DEVELOPMENT. RUPSA IS ALSO IMPLEMENTING AN SC SUBAWARD UNDER USAID'S WORKERS' EMPOWERMENT AND PARTICIPATION ACTIVITY. THROUGH THE SUBAWARD, RUPSA IS MANAGING A WORKER COMMUNITY CENTER AND IMPLEMENTING DOZENS OF ASSOCIATED ACTIVITIES INCLUDING TRAINING ON FUNDAMENTAL LABOR RIGHTS AND OSH, MEMBERSHIP BUILDING AMONG THE WORKER COMMUNITY ASSOCIATION, AND STRATEGIC ADVOCACY FOR ACCESS TO PUBLIC SERVICES. RUPSA HAS STRONG CONNECTIONS WITH SHRIMP FARMING WORKERS AND THEIR COMMUNITIES AND LOCAL AUTHORITIES IN THE PROJECT'S TARGET GEOGRAPHIC AREAS."}, {"date": "3/23/2025", "agency": "Department of Health

FUNDING WILL ALLOW THE CENTER TO CONTINUE ITS WORK IN UNDERSERVED, RURAL AND URBAN COMMUNITIES AND TO EXTEND SERVICES IN UNSERVED COMMUNITIES TO ADDRESS THE INADEQUACIES IN HOUSING. FUNDING FHCNA WILL ALLOW THE CENTER THE OPPORTUNITY TO ADDRESS POVERTY, SEGREGATION, INADEQUATE HOUSING STOCK, LACK OF EMPLOYMENT OPPORTUNITIES, AND OTHER FACTORS AFFECTING HOUSING AND HOUSING OPPORTUNITIES. FHCNA'S PURPOSE IS TO SUPPORT DIVERSITY IN HOUSING, TO INCLUDE SUFFICIENT HOUSING STOCK, ADVOCATE FOR SUPPORTIVE AND NEEDED AMENITIES IN MANY NEIGHBORHOODS SUCH AS MEDICAL FACILITIES, BANKS, LENDERS, ADEQUATE FOOD SUPPLY AND RECREATIONAL FACILITIES, ALL WHICH MAKE UP AN IDEAL COMMUNITY. FHCNA FUNDED IS ALSO NEEDED TO PROVIDE GUIDANCE FOR SMALL TOWN OFFICIALS WHO MIGHT NOT BE AS WELL VERSED IN WHAT AFFIRMATIVELY FURTHERING FAIR HOUSING AND ADDRESSING RACIAL EQUITY MEANS TO THEIR COMMUNITIES AND HOW ADDRESSING THESE WILL OPEN DOORS FOR OTHER COMMUNICATIONS AND ACHIEVEMENTS.; ACTIVITIES TO BE PERFORMED: FILL ANY VACANCIES NEEDED, ASSIGN STAFF TO PROJECT AND REVIEW ALL TASKS ASSOCIATED WITH THE POSITIONS. FHCNA PROPOSES TO CONDUCT MEETINGS WITH CITY AND COUNTY OFFICIALS AND OTHER PROVIDERS OF HOUSING TO DISCUSS VARIOUS TOPICS SUCH AS HOUSING STOCK, EMPLOYMENT OPPORTUNITIES, SEGREGATION, RESIDENTS WITH LIMITED ENGLISH DEFICIENCIES, DISABILITY ISSUES, ACCESSIBILITY TO CAPITAL, AND OTHER ISSUES THAT IMPACT GROWTH OF COMMUNITIES AND IMPACT ON RESIDENTS. FHCNA WILL CONTINUE TO PARTNER WITH AGENCIES THAT REPRESENT VARIOUS SEGMENTS OF THE COMMUNITIES SUCH AS HISPANICS, AFRICAN AMERICANS, DISABLED, PERSONS WITH LIMITED ENGLISH DEFICIENCIES, RURAL, LOW-INCOME, UNDERSERVED AND UNSERVED COMMUNITIES. STAFF WILL ATTEND COMMUNITY AND NEIGHBORHOOD MEETINGS IN AREAS THAT HAVE ESTABLISHED GROUPS OR WILL CONVENE WHERE FEASIBLE MEETINGS TO ADDRESS THE CONCERNS OF THE RESIDENTS. FHCNA WILL HOST ROUNDTABLE DISCUSSIONS TO ALLOW HOUSING PROVIDERS AND SOCIAL SERVICE PROVIDERS AN OPPORTUNITY TO OPENLY DISCUSS AREAS OF NEED THEY SEE IN THE COMMUNITIES THEY SERVICE AND SUGGESTED METHODS FOR ADDRESSING THE INEQUITIES THAT WILL BEST BENEFIT THEIR CLIENTS. FHCNA WILL ALSO HOLD ITS ANNUAL FAIR HOUSING MONTH SEMINAR AND LUNCHEON THAT PROVIDES FAIR HOUSING INFORMATION FROM NATIONALLY RECOGNIZED AND LOCAL FAIR HOUSING ADVOCATES ON SPECIFIC TOPICS OF INTEREST BOTH LOCALLY AND ON THE NATIONAL SCENE. SESSIONS WILL ADDRESS REASONABLE ACCOMMODATIONS, DESIGN AND CONSTRUCTION, LENDING, ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE, AND OTHER TOPICS THAT IMPACT HOUSING AND THE LACK OF EQUITABLE ACCESS TO HOUSING. THE STUDENT POSTER CONTEST WILL REMAIN AN ADDITION TO OUR FAIR HOUSING MONTH CELEBRATION. HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS FROM ALL 29 COUNTIES ARE ENCOURAGED TO PARTICIPATE. WE WILL CONTINUE DISTRIBUTING INFORMATION IN ENGLISH, SPANISH, GERMAN, AND KOREAN AS SOON AS IT BECOMES AVAILABLE. BILLBOARDS WILL BE STRATEGICALLY PLACED BASED UPON RECOMMENDATIONS FROM THE MEDIA COMPANY FOR BEST EXPOSURE PARTICULARLY IN RURAL AREAS IN BOTH ENGLISH AND SPANISH. OUR SOCIAL MEDIA CAMPAIGN USING FACEBOOK, TWITTER, LINKIN, OUR WEBSITE AND OTHER SOCIAL PLATFORMS WILL CONTINUE TO BE UTILIZED AS A MEANS OF DISTRIBUTING FAIR HOUSING INFORMATION. PERSONS ATTENDING ANY EVENTS REQUIRING SPECIAL ASSISTANCE WILL BE ASKED TO MAKE THEIR REQUEST IN ADVANCE SO THAT SERVICES MAY BE PROVIDED. WITH A.I. BECOMING A CONCERN IN THE HOUSING INDUSTRY PARTICULARLY REGARDING LENDING, AS NEW INFORMATION IS DEVELOPED, FHCNA WILL USE BILLBOARDS AND OTHER PRINTED MATERIALS TO ENLIGHTEN THE COMMUNITIES. OUR ENFORCEMENT COMPONENT WILL SERVE THE SEVEN PROTECTED CLASSES GUARANTEED PROTECTIONS UNDER THE FAIR HOUSING ACT. WE WILL INVESTIGATE COMPLAINTS OF ALLEGED HOUSING DISCRIMINATION, MEDIATE OR CONCILIATE AGREEMENTS AND/OR MAKE REFERRALS TO HUD, DOJ OR PRIVATE ATTORNEYS. ALL INTAKES WILL FOLLOW THE HUD APPROVED INTAKE PROCEDURES. ALL NON-FAIR HOUSING CASES WILL BE REFERRED TO OTHER AGENCIES FOR ASSISTANCE. WHERE FAIR HOUSING COMPLAINANTS REQUIRE OUR SERVICES AND THOSE OF OTHER AGENCIES, PROPER REFERRALS WILL BE MADE. THE ENFORCEMENT COMPONENT WILL CONSIST OF RECRUITING AND TRAINING POTENTIAL TESTERS. MAKING TEST ASSIGNMENTS, DEBRIEFING TESTERS, AND EVALUATING TEST TO DETERMINE THE NEXT ACTION. FHCNA WILL CONDUCT BOTH COMPLAINT AND SYSTEMIC BASED TEST. THE TYPES OF TESTS WILL INCLUDE RENTAL, SALES, LENDING AND INSURANCE. MORE COMPLEX TEST SUCH AS DESIGN AND CONSTRUCTION, APPRAISAL BIAS, SEXUAL ORIENTATION, DOMESTIC VIOLENCE AND CRIMINAL BACKGROUNDS HAVE ALL BEEN DEALT WITH BEFORE BUT ONLY AFTER A COMPLAINT HAS BEEN FILED AND WILL CONTINUE ON AN AS NEED BASIS UNTIL STAFF HAS RECEIVED TRAINING FOR THE MORE COMPLEX TESTING AND FEEL KNOWLEDGEABLE ENOUGH TO CONDUCT SYSTEMIC TESTING. THE SPECIFIC NUMBER OF EACH TYPE OF TEST WILL DIFFER EACH YEAR AND ADJUSTMENTS WILL BE MADE DURING NEGOTIATIONS TO REFLECT OUR PREVIOUS TESTS RESULTS, TYPES OF COMPLAINTS AND RESOLUTIONS. C. EXPECTED OUTCOMES: OUR AFFIRMATIVELY FURTHERING FAIR HOUSING ADVOCACY AND RACIAL EQUITY WORK SHOULD GENERATE PARTICULARLY IN RURAL, LOW-INCOME, UNSERVED AND UNDERSERVED AREAS, DISCUSSIONS ON LACK OF HOUSING STOCK, LACK OF JOB OPPORTUNITIES, NEED FOR SPECIALIZED HOUSING FOR THE ELDERLY AND DISABLED, AND SPECIAL ASSISTANCE FOR PERSONS WITH LIMITED ENGLISH PROFICIENCY. MEETINGS WITH OFFICIALS, COMMUNITY STAKE HOLDERS AND RESIDENTS WILL BEGIN A DIALOGUE AND THE PROCESS OF ADDRESSING CIVIL RIGHTS, SEGREGATION/INTEGRATION, PROBLEMS FACING THE BLACK AND BROWN COMMUNITIES, NEED FOR IMPROVED INFRASTRUCTURE, LIMITED ACCESS TO HOUSING, HOUSING MOBILITY, LACK OF ACCESS TO CAPITAL, AND OTHER LIMITED RESOURCES. IN SOME LOW-INCOME, RURAL COMMUNITIES, REGARDLESS OF THE EFFORTS MADE TO ADDRESS SOME OF THE INEQUITIES IN HOUSING CHOICE, LITTLE OR NO PROGRESS WILL BE MADE DUE TO THE LIMITED HOUSING STOCK AND OWNERSHIP OF MUCH OF THAT STOCK. FROM THE INITIAL CONTACTS IN SOME OF THE SMALL RURAL AREAS, MANY CITY OFFICIALS ARE NOT AWARE OF POSSIBLE SOURCES OF FUNDING AND ONLY RELY UPON THEIR CDBG ALLOCATIONS FROM THE STATE FOR NON-ENTITLEMENT CITIES. FROM OUR ADVOCACY WORK IN THOSE AREAS, SOME SMALL EFFORTS TOWARD MAKING IMPROVEMENTS SHOULD BECOME EVIDENT OVER A PERIOD OF TIME. MAKING THE RESIDENTS AWARE OF THEIR FAIR HOUSING RIGHTS AND OBLIGATIONS THROUGH OUR MEDIA CAMPAIGNS, USING BILLBOARDS, PRINTED MATERIALS IN DIFFERENT LANGUAGES, RADIO AND TELEVISION PSA'S WHERE POSSIBLE AND FACE TO FACE MEETINGS, WILL INEVITABLY CHANGE THEIR LIVES AND THEIR EXPECTATIONS OF WHAT CAN AND COULD POSSIBLY CHANGE IN THEIR COMMUNITIES. WE ANTICIPATE AN INCREASE IN THE NUMBER OF COMPLAINTS BEING FILED DUE TO OUR WORK IN BOTH OUR RURAL AND URBAN COMMUNITIES IF THIS PROPOSAL IS FUNDED. INCREASING THE UNDERSTANDING OF FAIR HOUSING IN ALL OF OUR COMMUNITIES, ESPECIALLY IN THE UNDERSERVED AND UNSERVED AREAS, THOSE BLACK AND BROWN COMMUNITIES, COMMUNITIES WITH PERSONS OF LIMITED ENGLISH PROFICIENCY AND LOW-INCOME AREAS, WITH A CLEARER UNDERSTANDING OF THE LAW, PERSONS WILL BETTER RECOGNIZE ACTS OF HOUSING DISCRIMINATION AND WILL BE MORE INCLINED TO FILE COMPLAINTS. WITH FREQUENT PERSONNEL CHANGES IN MULTI-FAMILY HOUSING PROVIDERS, FAIR HOUSING TRAININGS ARE ESSENTIAL TO THEIR PROVIDING QUALITY SERVICES AND WILL BE A CONTINUED SERVICE OFFERED. WHEN PROVIDING TRAININGS TO HOUSING PROVIDERS, AND OTHER INDUSTRY PARTICIPANTS, SUCH AS BUILDERS, OWNERS, AND ARCHITECTS, SOME DISCUSSIONS WILL INCLUDE REASONABLE ACCOMMODATION REQUEST, AND DESIGN AND CONSTRUCTION ISSUES WITH MANY CURRENT UNITS. DISCUSSIONS SURROUNDING THE NEED FOR NEW SINGLE FAMILY ACCESSIBLE HOUSING, AS WELL AS AN INCREASE IN ACCESSIBLE MULTI-FAMILY UNITS, THE AGING POPULATION AND THE APPARENT NEED FOR THIS HOUSING AND THE FINANCIAL IMPACT THESE NEW HOUSING OPPORTUNITIES WOULD PRESENT SHOULD RESULT IN SOME EVENTUAL CONSTRUCTION. NEW CONSTRUCTION IN ALL AREAS WHETHER LARGE, SMALL, RURAL OR URBAN COMMUNITIES WOULD GENERATE JOB OPPORTUNITIES THUS MAKING A POSITIVE IMPACT ON THE ECONOMY. OUR WORK WITH STUDENTS THROUGH OUR ANNUAL POSTER AND POETRY CONTESTS WILL SERVE TO INTRODUCE THEM TO THE CONCEPT OF FAIR AND EQUAL HOUSING OPPORTUNITIES FOR ALL PEOPLE. PROVIDING THEM, THEIR SCHOOLS AND FAMILIES WITH FAIR HOUSING LITERATURE WILL INCREASE THE NUMBER OF HOUSEHOLDS WITH VALUABLE INFORMATION. ALL OF OUR ADVOCACY WORK THROUGH EDUCATION AND TRAININGS, COMMUNITY MEETINGS, DISCUSSIONS WITH CITY AND COUNTY OFFICIALS, THE ESTABLISHMENT OF NEW PARTNERSHIPS WITH SOCIAL SERVICE AGENCIES, INTEREST GROUPS, PARTNERSHIPS WITH THE LOCAL HBCU'S, OTHER ADVOCACY GROUPS THAT REPRESENT LGBTQ+, HISPANIC AND OTHER ETHNICITIES, THE NAACP, RELIGIOUS ORGANIZATIONS, AND OTHERS; EXPECTED OUTCOMES: EXPECTED OUTCOMES: OUR AFFIRMATIVELY FURTHERING FAIR HOUSING ADVOCACY AND RACIAL EQUITY WORK SHOULD GENERATE PARTICULARLY IN RURAL, LOW-INCOME, UNSERVED AND UNDERSERVED AREAS, DISCUSSIONS ON LACK OF HOUSING STOCK, LACK OF JOB OPPORTUNITIES, NEED FOR SPECIALIZED HOUSING FOR THE ELDERLY AND DISABLED, AND SPECIAL ASSISTANCE FOR PERSONS WITH LIMITED ENGLISH PROFICIENCY.

WITH INCREASED KNOWLEDGE OF THEIR FAIR HOUSING RIGHTS, WE ANTICIPATE AT LEAST A 10 TO 15% INCREASE IN COMPLAINTS IN THE FIRST YEAR AND A GREATER INCREASE YEAR TWO AND THREE. THESE ALLEGED COMPLAINTS, AFTER THOROUGH INVESTIGATIONS, ARE EXPECTED TO INCREASE OUR NUMBER OF CREDIBLE, LEGITIMATE FILINGS WITH HUD, DOJ OR PRIVATE ATTORNEYS. SITE VISITS TO UNSERVED AND UNDERSERVED AREAS WILL PROVIDE NEEDED INFORMATION TO DETERMINE THE LIKELY HOOD OF SUCCESSFUL TESTING. DUE TO THE LACK OF HOUSING STOCK IN SOME AREAS, WE ACKNOWLEDGE TESTING WILL NOT BE FEASIBLE. WORK IN NEW AND OR UNTAPPED TERRITORY WILL ALSO ASSIST IN OUR TESTER RECRUITMENT EFFORTS. WHERE TESTING IN THEIR COMMUNITIES WOULD NOT BE POSSIBLE, NEW TESTERS CAN BE ASSIGNED TEST IN OTHER CITIES AND COUNTIES. D. INTENDED BENEFICIARIES: FHCNA WILL PROVIDE FAIR HOUSING EDUCATION-OUTREACH AND ENFORCEMENT SERVICES TO ALL PERSONS PROTECTED BY THE FEDERAL FAIR HOUSING ACT AND ALL CIVIL RIGHTS LAWS ADDRESSING FAIR AND EQUAL ACCESS TO HOUSING. THIS WILL INCLUDE ALL RESIDENTS IN OUR 29 COUNTIES SERVICE AREA.; INTENDED BENEFICIARIES: ASSISTANCE WILL BE PROVIDED REGARDLESS OF RACE, COLOR, NATIONAL ORIGIN, RELIGION, SEX, FAMILIAL STATUS OR DISABILITY. FHCNA STAFF WILL ATTEMPT TO COVER RURAL AND URBAN COMMUNITIES, REGARDLESS OF INCOME AND SOCIO-ECONOMIC STATUS. MUCH EMPHASIS WILL BE PLACED ON RURAL, LOW-INCOME COMMUNITIES, BLACK AND BROWN COMMUNITIES, AREAS WITH LIMITED ENGLISH SPEAKING RESIDENTS, SEGREGATED COMMUNITIES, COMMUNITIES LACKING ACCESS TO CAPITAL, AND COMMUNITIES WITH LOW HOUSING STOCK. DUE TO THE NUMBER OF REASONABLE ACCOMMODATION COMPLAINTS, EMPHASIS WILL ALSO BE DIRECTED TOWARDS PERSONS WITH DISABILITIES. WITH AN INCREASE IN THE NUMBER OF APPRAISAL BIAS COMPLAINTS IN OUR SERVICE AREA, WITH MUCH OF THE INFORMATION COMING FROM REAL ESTATE PROFESSIONALS AND SOME MINORITY LENDERS, THE CENTER HAS FORMED AN APPRAISAL BIAS TASK FORCE TO STUDY ITS IMPACT. WE WILL INVESTIGATE ALLEGED APPRAISAL BIAS CASES WHEN OUR EXPERTISE AND RESOURCES WILL PERMIT. FHCNA HAS BEEN LIMITED IN ITS WORK IN SOME OF THE COUNTIES IN THE NORTHERN MOST PART OF OUR SERVICE AREA DUE TO DISTANCE AND LACK OF COMMUNICATION. WITH THE COVID PANDEMIC AND THE NEED FOR STUDENTS TO ACCESS COMPUTERS WHILE STUDYING FROM HOME, TOWERS WERE ERECTED GIVING RESIDENTS ACCESS TO CELLPHONE SERVICE AND GREATER USE OF COMPUTERS. PEOPLE IN THOSE AREAS ARE NOW ABLE TO ACCESS SOCIAL MEDIA NETWORKS SUCH AS FACEBOOK, LINKEDLN, TWITTER, OUR WEBPAGE AND OTHERS WHERE WE SHARE VALUABLE FAIR HOUSING INFORMATION. OUR VIEWER NUMBERS INCREASED OVER THE LAST YEAR SUPPORTING OUR THEORY THAT IMPROVED MEDIA ACCESS HAS LED TO GREATER EXPOSURE TO OUR FAIR HOUSING INFORMATION. THEREFORE, INCREASING THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE BENEFITTING FROM OUR PROJECT. FUNDING FOR THIS PROPOSED PROJECT WILL ONLY INCREASE OUR SERVICES AND IMPACT A GREATER NUMBER OF PEOPLE. THE AREAS REFERENCED ARE HIGHLY POPULATED WITH BLACK AND BROWN PEOPLE, LOW-INCOME COMMUNITIES, LOW HOUSING STOCK, SEGREGATED AND HAVE RESIDENTS WITH LIMITED ENGLISH PROFICIENCY, ARE RURAL AND EITHER UNDERSERVED OR UNSERVED. THIS HAS PROVIDED GREATER PENETRATION INTO OUR TARGET COMMUNITIES SERVICING A TARGETED GROUP OF PEOPLE. FHCNA CONTINUES TO ADDRESS THE NEEDS OF ITS URBAN AREAS WHERE SEGREGATION REMAINS A CONCERN, WHERE GENTRIFICATION CONTINUES TO DISPLACE RESIDENTS, WHERE AFFORDABLE HOUSING REMAINS A MAJOR CONCERN. OUR ADVOCACY EFFORTS REMAIN A PRIORITY IN IDENTIFYING THE NEEDS OF THESE COMMUNITIES AND THE PEOPLE IMPACTED.

THE PRIMARY GOALS OF THESE PROJECTS ARE TO MITIGATE THE IMPACTS OF CLIMATE CHANGE, PROTECT CRITICAL BIODIVERSITY, AND ENHANCE THE LIVELIHOODS OF LOCAL COMMUNITIES. BLUE\u2019S FIRST PROJECT IN SIERRA LEONE WAS RECENTLY PUBLISHED AS A PIPELINE LISTING ON VERRA\u2019S VERIFIED CARBON STANDARDS (VCS) REGISTRY IN AUGUST 2023 AND CAN BE FOUND HERE.   GENERAL BACKGROUND INFORMATION AND COUNTRIES\u2019 CONTEXT:   ACCORDING TO THE USAID - FOREST CARBON, MARKETS AND COMMUNITIES (FCMC) PROJECT, MANGROVES IN WEST AFRICA REPRESENT 13% OF MANGROVE FORESTS WORLDWIDE AND COVER MORE THAN 2.4 MILLION HECTARES ACROSS 19 COUNTRIES. HOWEVER, THE REGION HAS EXPERIENCED A RAPID LOSS OF ITS MANGROVE COVER AT A RATE OF 1.7% PER YEAR. AT THE SAME TIME, COASTAL COMMUNITIES IN WEST AFRICA FACE HIGH POVERTY LEVELS,   INEQUALITY, FOOD INSECURITY, AND VULNERABILITY TO THE IMPACTS OF CLIMATE CHANGE SUCH AS SEA LEVEL RISE AND COASTAL EROSION. WOMEN IN PARTICULAR FACE INCREASED ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL MARGINALIZATION AND CLIMATE VULNERABILITY.   BLUE\u2019S PROJECT AREAS ARE HOME TO TRADITIONAL FISHING COMMUNITIES THAT HAVE TURNED TO MANGROVE CUTTING AS A WAY TO MAKE INCOME DUE TO DEPLETED FISH STOCKS FROM FOREIGN TRAWLERS. MANGROVE FORESTS IN SIERRA LEONE AND GUINEA ARE BEING DEFORESTED DUE TO COMMUNITY MEMBERS SELLING MANGROVE WOOD OR USING IT   FOR PRESERVING FISH THROUGH SMOKING, FUEL FOR COOKING, CONSTRUCTION PURPOSES, OR OTHER USES. FURTHER, MANGROVES PLAY AN ESSENTIAL ROLE AS NURSERY AREAS FOR FISH AND SHELLFISH, WHICH CONTRIBUTE MORE THAN $400 MILLION ANNUALLY TO THE REGIONAL ECONOMY. MANGROVE FORESTS ARE ALSO IMPORTANT FOR STABILIZING THE SHORELINE AND BUFFERING COMMUNITIES AGAINST THE IMPACTS OF STORMS AND SEA LEVEL RISE.   GUINEA   GUINEA\u2019S CONTINENTAL SHELF EXTENDS 300 KM, COVERING A 47,400 KM2 AREA DOTTED BY INLETS, TIDAL MARSHES, ESTUARIES, AND NUMEROUS OFFSHORE ISLANDS. MANGROVE AREAS, WHICH EXTEND ALONG MOST OF THE COAST AND UP TO 40 KM INLAND, REMAIN LARGE AND BIODIVERSE, BUT HAVE DECLINED BY MORE THAN 30% SINCE THE EARLY 1980S. A 2019 SURVEY BY NASA ESTIMATES TOTAL MANGROVE COVER AT 2,076 KM2, OF WHICH ONLY 1,000 KM2 CAN BE UTILIZED FOR SUSTAINABLE COMMERCIAL PURPOSES.\u00b9 THE GUINEAN MANGROVES ARE A COASTAL ECOREGION OF MANGROVE SWAMPS IN RIVERS AND ESTUARIES NEAR THE SHORELINE OF WEST AFRICA FROM SENEGAL TO SIERRA LEONE AND ARE HOME TO OVER 500 CRITICALLY ENDANGERED, ENDANGERED AND/OR VULNERABLE SPECIES ON THE IUCN RED LIST.

THIS PATTERN IS NOT UNIQUE TO COVID-19; IT HAS BEEN OBSERVED FOR OTHER INFECTIOUS DISEASES, INCLUDING SEASONAL INFLUENZA. VACCINE HESITANCY, UNDERSTOOD AS A DELAY IN THE ACCEPTANCE OF VACCINATION DESPITE AVAILABILITY OF VACCINATION SERVICES, IS THE PRIMARY ROADBLOCK FOR COVID-19 AND INFLUENZA VACCINATION AMONG LATINXS. THEORETICAL FRAMEWORKS ENDORSED BY THE SAGE WORKING GROUP ON VACCINE HESITANCY, AND PRIOR RESEARCH, ILLUSTRATE THAT INTERVENTIONS TO REDUCE VACCINE HESITANCY AND INCREASE VACCINE UPTAKE IN LATINXS SHOULD ADOPT STRATEGIES THAT: INCREASE VACCINE CONFIDENCE AND CONVENIENCE; REDUCE VACCINE COMPLACENCY; AND RESPOND TO CONTEXTUAL, INDIVIDUAL AND VACCINE-RELATED FACTORS DRIVING HESITANCY, WHICH INCLUDE BUT ARE NOT LIMITED TO THE SOCIAL DETERMINANTS OF HEALTH AND STRUCTURAL RACISM. WHILE A VARIETY OF STRATEGIES HAVE BEEN DEVELOPED TO ADDRESS VACCINE HESITANCY IN PRIORITY POPULATIONS, THE POTENTIAL ROLE OF BEHAVIORAL HEALTH IN COMMUNITY-BASED INTEGRATED HEALTH CARE SETTINGS HAS BEEN OVERLOOKED. YET BEHAVIORAL HEALTH, PARTICULARLY WITHIN FEDERALLY QUALIFIED HEALTH CENTERS (FQHCS) WHICH TARGET SOCIAL DETERMINANTS OF HEALTH, MAY BE AN IDEAL SETTING TO REACH LATINXS, AND OTHER PRIORITY POPULATIONS WITH MENTAL ILLNESS, TO ADDRESS VACCINE HESITANCY AND PROMOTE VACCINE UPTAKE. IN COLLABORATION WITH EAST BOSTON NEIGHBORHOOD HEALTH CENTER (EBNHC), THE LARGEST FQHC OF MASSACHUSETTS, THE PROPOSED STUDY WILL EVALUATE A NOVEL MOTIVATIONAL INTERVIEWING (MI) BEHAVIORAL INTERVENTION TO REDUCE VACCINE HESITANCY AND INCREASE COVID-19 AND INFLUENZA VACCINE UPTAKE IN LATINX ADULTS WITH MENTAL ILLNESS. KEY TO THE INTERVENTION IS THAT THE PROPOSED MI PROTOCOL EXPLICITLY ACKNOWLEDGES CULTURAL VALUES THAT ARE CENTRAL TO THE LATINX POPULATION AND THAT IMPACT THEIR INTERACTIONS WITH HEALTH CARE PROVIDERS. ADDITIONALLY, THE INTERVENTION HAS BEEN SPECIFICALLY DESIGNED TO BE FEASIBLE AND READILY IMPLEMENTED IN COMMUNITY-BASED SETTINGS, AND TO BE SUSTAINABLE IN THE LONG-TERM REGARDLESS OF HOW THE RAPIDLY CHANGING COVID-19 VACCINATION LANDSCAPE EVOLVES. TO RIGOROUSLY EVALUATE THE INTERVENTION, WE WILL CONDUCT A PRAGMATIC MULTIPLE-PERIOD CLUSTER-RANDOMIZED CROSSOVER TRIAL WITHIN FOUR BH PROGRAMS AT EBNHC; KEY TO THIS DESIGN IS THAT EACH PROGRAM SERVES AS ITS OWN CONTROL AND THAT THE MULTIPLE SWITCHES ENHANCE STATISTICAL POWER. TO OUR KNOWLEDGE, THIS WILL BE THE FIRST STUDY TO RIGOROUSLY EXAMINE THE POTENTIAL ROLE OF BH PROVIDERS IN INCREASING VACCINE UPTAKE AMONG LATINX ADULTS WITH MENTAL ILLNESS, A PARTICULARLY VULNERABLE POPULATION. KEY TO THE ANTICIPATED IMPACT IS THE PARTNERSHIP BETWEEN THE ACADEMIA-BASED RESEARCH TEAM AND COLLEAGUES AT EBNHC WHICH, IN TURN, WILL SUPPORT THE RAPID TRANSLATION OF EVIDENCE INTO PRACTICE TOGETHER

TWO LOW-INCOME, MULTIFAMILY RENTAL PROPERTIES WITH A HIGH PREVALENCE OF CHILDREN WITH ASTHMA AND POOR ENERGY PERFORMANCE, AND TO IMPLEMENT REMEDIATION MEASURES SUCH AS HVAC UPGRADES, MOLD REMEDIATION, AND PEST REMOVAL IN THESE BUILDINGS. THESE EFFORTS WILL DEMONSTRATE THE EFFECTIVENESS OF COMBINING DECARBONIZATION AND HEALTHY HOUSING REMEDIATION TO IMPROVE HEALTH OUTCOMES FOR UNDER-RESOURCED CHILDREN LIVING IN MULTI-FAMILY HOUSING WHILE REDUCING CARBON EMISSIONS. THIS PROJECT WILL ALSO DEMONSTRATE HOW THESE OVERALL BUILDING UPGRADES WILL IMPROVE INDOOR AIR QUALITY. RECENT RESEARCH HAS ELEVATED THE NEGATIVE HEALTH IMPACTS OF FOSSIL FUEL COMBUSTION IN BUILDINGS, INCLUDING TRIGGERING ASTHMA EPISODES IN CHILDREN. HOWEVER, DECARBONIZING HOUSING ALONE DOES NOT ADDRESS ALL ASTHMA CAUSES.  USING OUTSIDE FUNDING SOURCES, NHT WILL ADOPT A COLLABORATIVE PROBLEM-SOLVING WITH COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATION (CBO) PARTNERS TO CONDUCT OUTREACH AND EDUCATION ABOUT THEIR EFFORTS TO IMPROVE HEALTHY HOUSING. ACTIVITIES:THIS NHT PROJECT WILL INCLUDE THE FOLLOWING ACTIVITIES: A) IDENTIFY TWO LOW-INCOME MULTIFAMILY RENTAL PROPERTIES WITH A HIGH PREVALENCE OF CHILDREN WITH ASTHMA AND POOR ENERGY PERFORMANCE; B) PARTNER WITH A BLACK, INDIGENOUS AND PEOPLE OF COLOR (BIPOC)-LED CBO AND ENGAGE RESIDENTS THROUGH COMMUNITY-FACILITATED DISCUSSIONS AND DEVELOPMENT MEETINGS; C) CONDUCT HEALTHY HOUSING ASSESSMENTS AND DEVELOP A SCOPE OF WORK; AND D) IMPLEMENT REMEDIATION MEASURES AND E)DISSEMINATE PROJECT OUTCOMES, LESSONS LEARNED WITH RECOMMENDATIONS FOR SCALING AND REPLICATING THIS PILOT PROGRAM. IN ESSENCE, THIS EPA GRANT WILL LEVERAGE AN NHT-LED DECARBONIZATION INITIATIVE AIMING TO IDENTIFY SEPARATE FUNDING SOURCES FOR DECARBONIZATION UPGRADES IN AFFORDABLE MULTIFAMILY HOUSING. THE PARTNERING CBOS WILL CONDUCT EDUCATION AND OUTREACH ABOUT THIS PROJECT, HOWEVER, FUNDING FOR THESE CBOS IS NOT INCLUDED AS PART OF THIS EPA FUNDED PROJECT. SUBRECIPIENT:NO SUBAWARDS ARE INCLUDED IN THIS ASSISTANCE AGREEMENT.OUTCOMES:THE ANTICIPATED DELIVERABLES WITH INTENDED BENEFICIARY(IES) WILL INCLUDE THE NHT CONVENING POST-RETROFIT ALL-PARTNER MEETINGS TO IMPART LESSONS LEARNED FROM RESIDENT ENGAGEMENT ACTIVITIES AND REMEDIATION UPGRADES. ADDITIONALLY, CBO PARTNERS WILL DETERMINE BEST PRACTICE STRATEGIES FOR EQUITABLE RESIDENT ENGAGEMENT AND HEALTHY HOUSING REMEDIATION IN AFFORDABLE HOUSING. MOREOVER, THE NHT WILL: A) WRITE AND DISSEMINATE A SUMMARY REPORT OF THE PROJECT FINDINGS; B) PROVIDE PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION RECOMMENDATIONS FOR ITS CBO PARTNERS AND PROPERTY OWNERS; AND C) CONVEY POLICY AND PROGRAM DESIGN RECOMMENDATIONS FOR POLICYMAKERS.  THE EXPECTED OUTCOMES WITH INTENDED BENEFICIARY(IES) WILL INCLUDE THE LEVERAGING OF A LARGER NHT-LED INITIATIVE, BASED ON THIS PROPOSAL'S PROJECT, TO RETROFIT AND DECARBONIZE AFFORDABLE HOUSING. LAUNCHED IN LATE-2022 AND SEEDED WITH PHILANTHROPIC FUNDING, THE INITIATIVE INVOLVES WORKING WITH RESIDENTS, PROPERTY OWNERS, LENDERS, AND POLICYMAKERS TO SCALE UP RETROFITS OF MULTI-FAMILY PROPERTIES, RESULTING IN THE PRESERVATION OF AFFORDABLE HOUSING THAT IS SAFER AND HEALTHIER FOR RESIDENTS, COMMUNITIES, AND THE PLANET. THE OUTPUTS OF THIS GRANT-FUNDED PROJECT WILL INCLUDE USING THE MOMENTUM OF THIS PROPOSAL'S PROJECT TO CONVEY BEST PRACTICES FOR THE LARGER INITIATIVE. THE OUTPUTS WILL FOCUS ON THE GOAL OF PROMOTING SYSTEMS CHANGE RELATIVE TO HOW THESE RETROFIT PROJECTS ARE DESIGNED AND DEVELOPED IN THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA AND NATIONWIDE.

VULNERABLE POPULATIONS WILL BENEFIT FROM THESE RESULTS IN THREE PRIMARY WAYS. FIRST, STRONGER RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN GOVERNMENT AND CBOS WILL ENABLE MORE MEANINGFUL PARTICIPATION IN CLIMATE ADAPTATION AND RESILIENCE PLANNING AND A FINAL PLAN WITH STRATEGIES THAT CONNECT TO PEOPLE'S LIVED EXPERIENCE. SECOND, CREATING A PLAN THAT CENTERS EQUITY AND MEANINGFULLY INTEGRATES THE PERSPECTIVES OF VULNERABLE POPULATIONS BENEFITS THE WHOLE COMMUNITY. INTEGRATING EQUITY INTO CLIMATE ACTION PLANNING IS GOOD FOR EVERYONE IN THE COMMUNITY.

IT IS VITAL FOR RESEARCH ON THE ETHICAL, LEGAL, AND SOCIAL IMPLICATIONS (ELSI) OF GENOMICS TO UNDERSTAND THE ROLE OF RELIGION IN SHAPING PUBLIC ATTITUDES TOWARD GGH. NINETY PERCENT OF THE US PUBLIC BELIEVES IN SOME KIND OF HIGHER POWER AND 55% PRAY DAILY. THE US PUBLIC ATTENDS RELIGIOUS SERVICES AT A RATE 3 TIMES HIGHER THAN SCIENTISTS IN THE US, WHO ARE AT RISK OF MISUNDERSTANDING THE ROLE RELIGION PLAYS IN ATTITUDES TOWARD GGH. FURTHER, BLACK, HISPANIC, AND RURAL POPULATIONS ATTEND RELIGIOUS SERVICES MORE FREQUENTLY THAN THE GENERAL US PUBLIC. CONCERNS WITH GGH ACTIVITIES MAY LEAD TO LOWER LEVELS OF ENGAGEMENT OF GGH, WHICH MAY IN TURN CONTRIBUTE TO HEALTH DISPARITIES. THIS PROJECT AIMS TO UNDERSTAND WHY HIGHER LEVELS OF RELIGIOUS PRACTICE ARE ASSOCIATED WITH GREATER CONCERNS WITH GGH ACTIVITIES.  ADDITIONALLY, THIS PROJECT WILL INTERVIEW FAITH LEADERS TO IDENTIFY HOW PUBLIC HEALTH GENOMICS MIGHT ENGAGE FAITH COMMUNITIES IN WAYS THAT ARE RESPECTFUL AND CONSTRUCTIVE. WHILE SOME CONCERNS WITH HEALTHCARE TECHNOLOGIES MAY DISAPPEAR WITH NEW INFORMATION, OTHERS STEM FROM WORLDVIEWS, DEEP MORAL COMMITMENTS, OR MISTRUST OF THE HEALTHCARE SYSTEM. ENGAGING RELIGIOUS COMMUNITIES IS ESSENTIAL TO IDENTIFY WHICH CONCERNS CAN BE ADDRESSED WITH INFORMATION, WHICH CALL FOR ALTERNATIVE RESPONSES, AND WHAT ALTERNATIVE RESPONSES MIGHT LOOK LIKE. VERY FEW MODELS EXIST FOR GENOMIC PUBLIC HEALTH ENGAGEMENT WITH RELIGION, PARTICULARLY MODELS THAT DIRECTLY ADDRESS VALUE-LADEN CONCERNS.13,14 THIS PROJECT WILL ACHIEVE TWO SPECIFIC AIMS: 1. QUANTITATIVELY EXAMINE WHICH ASPECTS OF RELIGION EXPLAIN ITS INFLUENCE ON SUPPORT FOR GGH ACTIVITIES. WE WILL SURVEY 4800 ADULTS IN THE US TO EXAMINE THE ASSOCIATION OF RELIGIOUS VARIABLES WITH SUPPORT FOR GGH ACTIVITIES SUCH AS PRENATAL GENETIC TESTING, GENE EDITING, AND MRNA VACCINES. WE WILL GENERATE RICH DESCRIPTIVE DATA AND EXPLORE HOW AND WHEN DIVERSE RELIGIOUS VARIABLES PREDICT SUPPORT FOR, OR OPPOSITION TO, GGH ACTIVITIES. 2. EXPLORE HOW GENOMIC PUBLIC HEALTH CAN ENGAGE WITH RELIGIOUS COMMUNITIES IN A WAY THAT IS RESPECTFUL AND CONSTRUCTIVE. WE WILL CONDUCT IN-DEPTH INTERVIEWS VIA ZOOM WITH 180 FAITH LEADERS\u201430 FROM EACH OF SIX GROUPS: EVANGELICAL, MAINLINE PROTESTANT, HISTORICALLY BLACK, AND CATHOLIC CHRISTIANITY, JUDAISM, AND ISLAM. THESE GROUPS REPRESENT THE LARGEST RELIGIOUS GROUPS IN THE US, COMPRISING 90% OF THOSE WITH A RELIGIOUS AFFILIATION. INTERVIEWS WILL EXPLORE SEVERAL DIFFERENT ISSUES: WHAT ARE THEIR VIEWS ON GGH ACTIVITIES? IS DIVERSITY OF OPINION ON THESE MATTERS TOLERATED WITHIN THEIR COMMUNITY? TO WHAT EXTENT ARE CONCERNS WITH GGH ACTIVITIES PRINCIPLED AND TO WHAT EXTENT MIGHT FURTHER INFORMATION BE HELPFUL? HOW MIGHT GENOMIC PUBLIC HEALTH ENGAGE RELIGIOUS COMMUNITIES IN A WAY THAT IS BOTH RESPECTFUL AND CONSTRUCTIVE?"}, {"date": "2/26/2025", "agency": "Department of State", "recipient": "INTERNATIONAL ORGANIZATION FOR MIGRATION", "value": 1130000, "savings": 457986, "link": null, "description": "Currently unavailable"}, {"date": "3/23/2025", "agency": "Department of Health and Human Services", "recipient": "HEALTH RESEARCH, INC.", "value": 840583, "savings": 457954, "link": null, "description": "Currently unavailable"}, {"date": "3/23/2025", "agency": "Department of Health and Human Services", "recipient": "STATE OF GEORGIA DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH", "value": 38825591, "savings": 457167, "link": null, "description": "Currently unavailable"}, {"date": "3/7/2025", "agency": "Environmental Protection Agency", "recipient": "University of Massachusetts Dartmouth", "value": 500000, "savings": 456449, "link": "https://usaspending.gov/award/ASST_NON_84081901_6800", "description": "DESCRIPTION:THIS AGREEMENT PROVIDES FUNDING TO THE UNIVERSITY OF MASSACHUSETTS DARTMOUTH (PROVIDER/RECIPIENT) TO PROVIDE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE AND RELATED SUPPORT TO UNDERSERVED COMMUNITIES IN AND AROUND MASSACHUSETTS AND EPA REGION 1.

THE FHJC IS SEEKING AN FY2024 FHIP FHOI CONTINUING DEVELOPMENT COMPONENT GRANT TO PROVIDE HIGH-QUALITY COMPREHENSIVE FAIR HOUSING TESTING SERVICES AND ENFORCEMENT ACTIVITIES, SPECIFICALLY IN PRE-APPLICATION MORTGAGE LENDING PRACTICES OF HOUSING SALES LENDERS.; ACTIVITIES TO BE PERFORMED: ACTIVITIES TO BE PERFORMED: THE FHJC WILL CONDUCT 35 FAIR HOUSING TESTS ACROSS ITS SERVICE AREA. INVESTIGATIONS WILL BE SYSTEMIC AND FOCUSED ON PRE-APPLICATION MORTGAGE LENDING PRACTICES AND HOUSING SALES TO DETERMINE WHETHER HOME BUYERS ARE BEING AFFORDED THE SAME SERVICE, TREATMENT, AND INFORMATION ABOUT AND ACCESS TO MORTGAGE FINANCING SERVICES AND PRODUCTS WITHOUT DISCRIMINATING BASED ON PROTECTED CHARACTERISTICS UNDER THE FEDERAL FAIR HOUSING ACT AND APPLICABLE LOCAL AND STATE LAWS. TESTING WILL FOCUS ON LENDERS LOCATED IN TOWNS, CITIES AND NEIGHBORHOODS THAT HAVE HISTORICALLY EXPERIENCED AND ARE EXPERIENCING PATTERNS OF RACIAL SEGREGATION. AS THE FHJC IS THE ONLY FULL SERVICE FAIR HOUSING ORGANIZATION OPERATING WITHIN THE FIVE NEW YORK CITY BOROUGHS, AND THERE IS A LACK OF LENDING TESTING HAPPENING IN THE REST OF THE NEW YORK CITY REGION, THERE WILL BE NO SHORTAGE OF AREAS AND ENTITIES ON WHICH TO FOCUS TESTING. LENDER TESTING INVESTIGATIONS ARE EXTREMELY TIME-CONSUMING, INVOLVE COMPLEX TRANSACTIONS, REQUIRE CAREFUL DESIGN AND SUPERVISION BY A SKILLED INVESTIGATIVE COORDINATOR, AND MUST BE EXECUTED BY TESTERS WHO ARE WELL-TRAINED AND WHO HAVE EXCEPTIONAL ACTING ABILITIES. THE FHJC HIRES AND TRAINS PROFESSIONAL ACTORS TO CONDUCT LENDING TESTS, AND THE FHJC\u2019S NATIONAL PROJECTS AND INVESTIGATIONS COORDINATOR (PROPOSED PROJECT MANAGER) AND NATIONAL FIELD CONSULTANT HAVE EXTENSIVE EXPERIENCE IN LENDING TESTING. THEY ARE TRAINERS FOR THE HUD FHIP FUNDED INVESTIGATIVE SUPPORT FOR TESTING AND ENFORCEMENT PROGRAMS (ISTEP). IN THIS CAPACITY THEY HAVE TRAINED HUNDREDS OF INVESTIGATIVE COORDINATORS ACROSS THE COUNTRY IN BEST PRACTICES FOR FAIR HOUSING TESTING IN SALES, LENDING, AND RENTALS. THEIR EXPERIENCE IS FURTHER DESCRIBED IN THE STAFF EXPERIENCE AND EXPERTISE SECTION. THE FHJC CURRENTLY EMPLOYS 8 INVESTIGATIVE COORDINATORS, INCLUDING A DIRECTOR OF INVESTIGATIONS (8 YEARS GENERAL TESTING EXPERIENCE), A NATIONAL PROJECTS AND INVESTIGATIONS COORDINATOR (6 YEARS GENERAL TESTING EXPERIENCE), AND A NATIONAL FIELD CONSULTANT (48 YEARS GENERAL TESTING EXPERIENCE), EACH OF WHOM SUPERVISES TESTING INVESTIGATIONS. THE FHJC ALSO EMPLOYS AN EVIDENCE MANAGER (4 YEARS OF EXPERIENCE) WHO PROVIDES SUPPORT TO THE INVESTIGATIVE COORDINATORS AND IS RESPONSIBLE FOR THE CONTROL, TRANSFER, MAINTENANCE, AND STORAGE OF ALL TESTING DATA AND EVIDENCE. MANY OF THESE STAFF MEMBERS HAVE DIRECT EXPERIENCE CONDUCTING LENDING AND SALES TESTING. THE FHJC HAS ALSO DEVELOPED WHAT IS LIKELY THE MOST PROFESSIONAL AND EXTENSIVE POOL OF TESTERS IN THE COUNTRY.; EXPECTED OUTCOMES: EXPECTED OUTCOMES: TO OVERCOME THE SIGNIFICANT EXISTING BARRIERS OF SYSTEMIC DISCRIMINATION AND SEGREGATION, THE FHJC USES EVIDENCE THAT REVEALS A PATTERN OF SYSTEMIC DISCRIMINATION TO BRING ENFORCEMENT ACTIONS AGAINST HOUSING PROVIDERS, REAL ESTATE AGENTS, AND LENDING INSTITUTIONS. ENFORCEMENT ACTIONS WILL INCLUDE FILING LAWSUITS AND ADMINISTRATIVE COMPLAINTS WITH LOCAL, STATE, AND FEDERAL AGENCIES. THE FHJC WILL ALSO PROVIDE INTAKE COUNSELING TO INDIVIDUALS WHO BELIEVE THEY HAVE BEEN DISCRIMINATED AGAINST IN THE LENDING CONTEXT, AND REFERRALS TO LEGAL COUNSEL IF APPROPRIATE. IF THESE INDIVIDUALS BRING THEIR OWN ENFORCEMENT ACTIONS, THE FHJC WILL BE AVAILABLE IF NEEDED. THE FHJC\u2019S OUTREACH, SOCIAL MEDIA, AND WRITTEN MATERIAL DISTRIBUTED AS PART OF THIS PROJECT WILL ENSURE THAT ADVOCATES AND AFFECTED COMMUNITY MEMBERS UNDERSTAND THEIR FAIR HOUSING RIGHTS, KNOW HOW TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THE FHJC\u2019S SERVICES, ARE ABLE TO ENGAGE IN SELF-ADVOCACY, AND ARE AWARE OF WHERE THEY CAN BRING AN ENFORCEMENT ACTION. THE FHJC COLLECTS EVIDENCE IN AN IMPARTIAL MANNER, DOCUMENTING THE EVERYDAY, UNVARNISHED BUSINESS OPERATIONS OF HOUSING PROVIDERS. AS SUCH, IT IS NOT POSSIBLE OR APPROPRIATE TO PREDICT OR ESTIMATE THE NUMBER OR NATURE OF ENFORCEMENT ACTIONS IT WILL FILE. THIS WOULD ALSO HAVE THE POSSIBLE EFFECT OF COMPROMISING ITS LAWSUITS. HOWEVER, IT IS PRUDENT TO NOTE THAT THE FHJC\u2019S SERVICE AREA HAS A POPULATION OF OVER THIRTEEN MILLION PEOPLE, INCLUDING THE NATION\u2019S LARGEST CITY. THE SCALE OF FAIR HOUSING INVESTIGATIONS IN THIS AREA REMAINS WOEFULLY INADEQUATE AND THE FHJC\u2019S LITIGATION PROGRAM IS ROBUST AND SUCCESSFUL. IN CONSIDERING THE EXPECTED OUTCOMES OF THIS PROJECT, PAST FHJC LAWSUITS ARE INSTRUCTIVE. IN FEBRUARY 2015, THE FHJC AND NINE BLACK, LATINO, ASIAN, AND WHITE TESTERS FILED A FEDERAL LAWSUIT AGAINST M&T BANK, THE 17TH LARGEST BANK IN THE UNITED STATES, ALLEGING THAT THE BANK WAS ENGAGED IN DISCRIMINATION BASED ON RACE AND NATIONAL ORIGIN. THE CASE, FHJC ET AL. V. M&T BANK ET AL., IS BELIEVED TO BE THE FIRST LAWSUIT FILED UNDER THE FEDERAL FAIR HOUSING ACT ALLEGING RACE AND NATIONAL ORIGIN DISCRIMINATION BASED PRIMARILY ON EVIDENCE COLLECTED THROUGH A PRE-APPLICATION MORTGAGE LENDER TESTING INVESTIGATION. IN AUGUST 2015, THE CASE WAS RESOLVED FOR A TOTAL MONETARY RECOVERY OF $485,000 AND EXTENSIVE INJUNCTIVE RELIEF, INCLUDING ADOPTING A BANK-WIDE POLICY PROHIBITING STEERING, POSTING ITS REVISED FAIR LENDING POLICY ON ITS WEBSITE, AND RETAINING A CONSULTANT TO REVISE ITS FAIR LENDING TRAINING FOR LOAN OFFICERS AND OTHER BANK EMPLOYEES. M&T LOAN OFFICERS IN THE FHJC\u2019S SERVICE AREA ARE NOW PROVIDING WRITTEN ESTIMATES, UPON REQUEST, TO CONSUMERS CONCERNING LOAN AMOUNTS, LOAN PRODUCTS, HOME PURCHASE PRICES, INTEREST RATES, AND DOWN PAYMENT REQUIREMENTS. IN NOVEMBER 2016, THE FHJC FILED A SUIT AGAINST ULSTER SAVINGS BANK FOR LENDING DISCRIMINATION, ALSO BASED ON EVIDENCE GATHERED IN PRE-APPLICATION LENDING TESTING. THE FHJC CONDUCTED A TWO-YEAR TESTING INVESTIGATION, WHICH REVEALED THAT LOAN OFFICERS REPEATEDLY RECOMMENDED LOWER HOME PRICES AND LOAN AMOUNTS AND LESS FAVORABLE TERMS FOR BLACK APPLICANTS WHO PRESENTED BETTER QUALIFICATIONS\u2014HIGHER INCOMES, MORE ASSETS, LESS DEBT, AND BETTER CREDIT SCORES\u2014THAN THE WHITE TESTERS WITH WHOM THEY WERE MATCHED. IN THE 2017 LAWSUIT SETTLEMENT, ULSTER SAVINGS BANK AGREED TO EXTENSIVE INJUNCTIVE RELIEF.; INTENDED BENEFICIARIES: NTENDED BENEFICIARIES: THIS PROJECT WILL BENEFIT HOMEBUYERS IN THE NEW YORK CITY REGION WITH ANY CHARACTERISTIC THAT IS PROTECTED UNDER LOCAL, STATE, OR FEDERAL FAIR HOUSING LAWS. IN PARTICULAR, IT WILL FOCUS ON ELIMINATING DISCRIMINATION AGAINST PEOPLE WHO ARE BLACK, LATINO, OR ASIAN AMERICAN PACIFIC ISLANDER (AAPI) AND MENA (MIDDLE EASTERN AND NORTH AFRICAN) COMMUNITY MEMBERS, AS WELL AS IMMIGRANTS, ESPECIALLY THOSE WITH LIMITED ENGLISH PROFICIENCY (LEP). AMONG THESE GROUPS, THE FHJC SERVES COMMUNITIES THAT HAVE EXPERIENCED HISTORIC AND CONTINUING PATTERNS OF SEGREGATION, DISCRIMINATION, AND EXCLUSION IN HOUSING \u2013 ACROSS VARIOUS AND INTERSECTING LINES INCLUDING DISABILITY, LAWFUL SOURCE OF INCOME, SEX, SEXUAL ORIENTATION/GENDER IDENTITY, RELIGION, CITIZENSHIP/IMMIGRATION STATUS, FAMILIAL STATUS, AND AGE. MANY THEORIES HAVE BEEN ADVANCED OVER THE YEARS ABOUT WHAT TRANSPIRES WHEN EQUALLY QUALIFIED CONSUMERS OF DIFFERENT RACES AND NATIONAL ORIGINS CONTACT LENDERS TO SEEK FINANCING TO PURCHASE A HOME. TESTING IS ONE OF THE FEW INVESTIGATIVE TECHNIQUES THAT CAN BE USED TO OBSERVE EXACTLY WHAT OCCURS AT THE PRE-APPLICATION STAGE OF A MORTGAGE LENDING TRANSACTION. BECAUSE OF THE INSIDIOUS NATURE OF DISCRIMINATORY LENDING PRACTICES, IT IS OFTEN DIFFICULT FOR CONSUMERS OF DIFFERENT RACES AND NATIONAL ORIGINS TO KNOW IF LOAN OFFICERS ARE PROVIDING THE SAME LEVEL OF ASSISTANCE, SERVICE, TREATMENT, AND FINANCING INFORMATION WITHOUT SOME TYPE OF COMPARISON. TESTING IS THE ONLY INVESTIGATIVE TOOL THAT CAN PROVIDE A MEANINGFUL COMPARISON AT THE PRE APPLICATION STAGE OF A MORTGAGE LENDING TRANSACTION. THE WORK OF THE FHJC IN THIS AREA HAS BEEN GROUND-BREAKING AND SINCE LITTLE LENDER TESTING IS CONDUCTED NATIONALLY, IT HAS PROVIDED A FRAMEWORK FOR HOW TO DEVELOP MORTGAGE LENDING CASES BASED PRIMARILY ON TESTING EVIDENCE AT THE PRE-APPLICATION STAGE RATHER THAN SOLELY RELYING ON DATA OBTAINED AFTER AN INDIVIDUAL HAS APPLIED. THIS PROCESS HAS UNVEILED VALUABLE INSIGHTS INTO LENDER PRACTICES THAT HAVE NOT BEEN WIDELY RESEARCHED OR INVESTIGATED BY FAIR LENDING ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES. THE NEW YORK CITY REGION HAS ONE OF THE MOST DIVERSE POPULATIONS IN THE UNITED STATES, AND YET, HOUSING DISCRIMINATION AND RESIDENTIAL SEGREGATION ARE DEEPLY PERVASIVE. BY APPLYING A DISSIMILARITY INDEX TO 2020 CENSUS DATA, RESEARCHERS HAVE SHOWN THAT NEW YORK CITY IS ONE OF THE MOST SEGREGATED METROPOLITAN REGIONS IN THE COUNTRY. IT REMAINS ONE OF SIX METROPOLITAN REGIONS WITH A SEGREGATION INDEX ABOVE 80. OF THE 50 METROPOLITAN AREAS IN THE NATION WITH THE LARGEST BLACK, LATINO, AND AAPI POPULATIONS, THE NEW YORK REGION RANKS AS ONE OF THE MOST SEGREGATED AREAS FOR ALL THREE GROUPS. THIS PROJECT WILL BENEFIT PEOPLE OF COLOR WHO LIVE IN SEGREGATED COMMUNITIES AND ALLOW THEM TO LIVE WITHOUT PENALTY IN NEIGHBORHOODS OF THEIR CHOICE. FURTHERMORE, THIS PROJECT WILL BENEFIT ALL RESIDENTS OF THE NEW YORK CITY REGION. HOUSING DISCRIMINATION DOES IMMENSE HARM NOT ONLY TO FAMILIES AND INDIVIDUALS, BUT TO ENTIRE COMMUNITIES. HOUSING DISCRIMINATION NOT ONLY RESTRICTS HOUSING CHOICE BUT ALSO PERPETUATES RESIDENTIAL SEGREGATION. SEGREGATION OFTEN LEADS TO FURTHER DISENFRANCHISEMENT, AS COMMUNITIES OF COLOR, BASED ON THE ZIP CODES TO WHICH THEY ARE CONFINED, FACE ADDITIONAL BARRIERS IN THEIR ACCESS TO HEALTHCARE, EDUCATION, TRANSPORTATION, AND EMPLOYMENT. THIS PROJECT WILL HELP ADDRESS THIS LEGACY OF HISTORICAL DISCRIMINATION.; SUBRECIPIENT ACTIVITIES: NONE"}, {"date": "2/26/2025", "agency": "Department of State", "recipient": "UNITED NATIONS OFFICE ON DRUGS AND CRIME", "value": 1185122, "savings": 215592, "link": null, "description": "Currently unavailable"}, {"date": "3/23/2025", "agency": "Department of Health and Human Services", "recipient": "HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES, NEBRASKA DEPARTMENT OF", "value": 225605, "savings": 215457, "link": null, "description": "Currently unavailable"}, {"date": "3/23/2025", "agency": "Department of Health and Human Services", "recipient": "UNIVERSITY OF VERMONT", "value": 1228640, "savings": 215393, "link": null, "description": "Currently unavailable"}, {"date": "2/26/2025", "agency": "Department of State", "recipient": "PACT, INC.", "value": 1480740, "savings": 214820.13, "link": null, "description": "Currently unavailable"}, {"date": "3/1/2025", "agency": "USAID", "recipient": "MERCY CORPS", "value": 644523, "savings": 214523, "link": "https://usaspending.gov/award/ASST_NON_720BHA24GR00004_7200", "description": "TO SUPPORTIVE HUMANITARIAN COORDINATION, INFORMATION MANAGEMENT, AND ASSESSMENTS (HCIMA) ACTIVITIES IN LEBANON"}, {"date": "2/26/2025", "agency": "Department of State", "recipient": "INTERNATIONAL ORGANIZATION FOR MIGRATION", "value": 428000, "savings": 214000, "link": "https://usaspending.gov/award/ASST_NON_SPRMCO24VC0146_1900", "description": "PROTECTION AND ASSISTANCE TO VULNERABLE MIGRANTS, INCLUDING CHILDREN, AT BANGKOK IMMIGRATION DETENTION CENTERS"}, {"date": "2/26/2025", "agency": "Department of State", "recipient": "Center for Legal Aid and Regional Development", "value": 285888, "savings": 213455.67, "link": "https://usaspending.gov/award/ASST_NON_SKV42025GR0003_1900", "description": "FOSTERING LINKS BETWEEN JUSTICE AND RULE OF LAW SECTOR INSTITUTIONS AND THE COMMUNITIES THEY SERVE THROUGH SUPPORT TO LOCAL CIVIL SOCIETY AND EDUCATIONAL ORGANIZATIONS, INCLUDING EFFORTS TO RAISE AWARENESS ABOUT HUMAN RIGHTS, ANTI-CORRUPTION, GENDER-BASE"}, {"date": "3/23/2025", "agency": "Department of Defense", "recipient": "University of California, Santa Cruz,\u00a0United States", "value": 750000, "savings": 212811, "link": "https://usaspending.gov/award/ASST_NON_N000142312527_1700", "description": "IDENTIFICATION OF NAVY-RELEVANT OCEANOGRAPHIC HOTSPOTS GUIDED BY ETHICAL PRACTICES AND EXPERIENTIAL LEARNING"}, {"date": "2/26/2025", "agency": "Department of State", "recipient": "EMPOWER PEACE", "value": 212500, "savings": 212500, "link": null, "description": "Currently unavailable"}, {"date": "2/27/2025", "agency": "Housing and Urban Development", "recipient": "Community Legal Aid Society, Inc.", "value": 425000, "savings": 212500, "link": "https://usaspending.gov/award/ASST_NON_FPEI230091_8611", "description": "PURPOSE: THE PURPOSE OF THIS PROJECT IS TO REDUCE THE INSTANCES OF HOUSING DISCRIMINATION AGAINST MEMBERS OF THE PROTECTED CLASSES IN THE STATE OF DELAWARE THROUGH INCREASED ENFORCEMENT EFFORTS.

THEY ARE BOTH HIGHLY RACIALLY SEGREGATED AND HAVE MULTIPLE DISCRIMINATORY BARRIERS TO FAIR HOUSING IDENTIFIED IN THEIR ANALYSES OF IMPEDIMENTS AND CONSOLIDATED PLANS. MULTIPLE DATA SOURCES REVIEWED BY NFHA SHOW THAT KANSAS CITY AND JACKSON HAVE LARGE HOMEOWNERSHIP GAPS BETWEEN HOUSEHOLDS OF COLOR AND WHITE HOUSEHOLDS; HAVE LENDING PATTERNS THAT DISPLAY LARGE GAPS IN LENDING BETWEEN WHITE AND BLACK APPLICANTS; REPORT FAILURES TO MAKE REASONABLE ACCOMMODATIONS; HAVE AN INSUFFICIENT SUPPLY OF AFFORDABLE HOUSING, ESPECIALLY ACCESSIBLE AFFORDABLE HOUSING; HAVE INSUFFICIENT FAIR HOUSING EDUCATION; AND, HAVE AN INSUFFICIENT UNDERSTANDING OF CREDIT.; ACTIVITIES TO BE PERFORMED: NFHA\u2019S PROPOSED GRANT ACTIVITIES WILL ADDRESS ALL OF THESE BARRIERS TO FAIR HOUSING. THE COMPLAINT-BASED AND SYSTEMIC INVESTIGATIONS PROPOSED UNDER THIS PROJECT WILL SERVE AS THE BASIS FOR ENFORCEMENT ACTIONS UNDER THE FAIR HOUSING ACT (FHA) THROUGH HUD, STATE OR LOCAL FAIR HOUSING ASSISTANCE PROGRAMS, THE U.S. DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE, AND FEDERAL COURT. ENFORCEMENT ACTIONS WILL ELIMINATE DISCRIMINATION AND REMEDY THE HARM THROUGH AFFIRMATIVE RELIEF. NFHA WILL ALSO CONTINUE TO DEVELOP AT LEAST 4 SYSTEMIC INVESTIGATIONS AND 8 PENDING ENFORCEMENT ACTIONS INITIATED UNDER PREVIOUS FHIP AWARDS. NFHA WILL ALSO CONDUCT COMPREHENSIVE EDUCATION AND OUTREACH REGARDING THE FHA IN BOTH METRO AREAS AS IT IMPLEMENTS ITS INVESTIGATIONS. EDUCATION AND OUTREACH WILL INCLUDE SPEAKING WITH ORGANIZATIONS SUCH AS HOUSING COUNSELING CENTERS, RELIGIOUS INSTITUTIONS AND COALITIONS, UNIVERSITIES, DISABILITY RIGHTS GROUPS, COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT CORPORATIONS, YOUTH SERVICE AND FAMILY SERVICE ORGANIZATIONS, AND ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE ORGANIZATIONS, AMONG OTHERS. NFHA\u2019S ROBUST EDUCATION AND OUTREACH IN THESE TWO METRO AREAS WILL ADDRESS SEVERELY LACKING KNOWLEDGE AND UNDERSTANDING OF FAIR HOUSING LAWS AND RIGHTS, AND ITS EXTENSIVE EXPERIENCE IN CONDUCTING BROAD-BASED FAIR HOUSING INVESTIGATIONS AND ENFORCEMENT WILL ELIMINATE DISCRIMINATORY BARRIERS FOR ALL PEOPLE PROTECTED BY THE FAIR HOUSING ACT. ACTIVITIES TO BE PERFORMED (UP TO 4,900 CHARACTER LIMIT) UNDER THIS PROJECT, NFHA WILL IMPLEMENT A FULL-SERVICE AND BROAD-BASED PROJECT THAT INCLUDES COMPLAINT INTAKE AND REFERRAL, EDUCATION AND OUTREACH, AND SYSTEMIC INVESTIGATIONS IN RENTAL, REAL ESTATE SALES, MORTGAGE LENDING AND REDLINING, DESIGN AND CONSTRUCTION, AND INSURANCE. NFHA WILL INVESTIGATE FHA COMPLAINTS TO CHALLENGE DISCRIMINATION IN JACKSON, MS, AND KANSAS CITY, KS/MO, WHICH ARE UNDERSERVED. NFHA WILL CONDUCT AT LEAST 366 RENTAL, SALES, MORTGAGE LENDING, DESIGN AND CONSTRUCTION, AND INSURANCE TESTS AND 60 REDLINING INVESTIGATIONS DURING THE GRANT PERIOD. NFHA\u2019S PROJECT HAS FIVE RELATED TESTING AND INVESTIGATION ACTIVITIES DESIGNED TO PROVIDE A STRATEGIC, SYSTEMIC APPROACH TO CHALLENGING ILLEGAL ACTIVITIES BY LANDLORDS AND RENTAL MANAGEMENT FIRMS, REAL ESTATE FIRMS, HOMEOWNERS INSURANCE COMPANIES, MORTGAGE LENDERS, BANKS, BUILDERS, DEVELOPERS, AND  ARCHITECTS.

THE COMPLAINTS PROGRAM PROVIDES THREE CORE SERVICES TO PEOPLE REQUESTING ASSISTANCE: INFORMATION AND RESOURCES; TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE; AND REFERRAL TO LEGAL SERVICES FOR ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES (HUD OR THE MASSACHUSETTS COMMISSION AGAINST DISCRIMINATION). TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE IS A SUCCESSFUL FEATURE OF THE COMPLAINTS PROGRAM, AND ALLOWS FHP STAFF TO FAVORABLY RESOLVE COMPLAINTS OF HOUSING DISCRIMINATION QUICKLY AND WITHOUT HAVING TO REFER TO FAIR HOUSING ENFORCEMENT. KEY TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE INCLUDES HELPING CLIENTS REQUEST ACCOMMODATIONS AND MODIFICATIONS, CONFRONT HOUSING PROVIDERS TO STOP DISCRIMINATORY ACTIVITY, HELP DRAFT ENFORCEMENT COMPLAINTS, ACCESS ADMINISTRATIVE APPEALS RELATED TO HOUSING BENEFITS, AND ASK FOR VAWA PROTECTIONS. THE FHP CLIENT MANAGEMENT DATABASE TRACKS COMPLAINTS BY PROTECTED CLASS, LEGAL ISSUE, GEOGRAPHIC LOCATION, RACE/ETHNICITY (VOLUNTARY), AGE, AND SERVICE PROVIDED, INCLUDING AGENCY TO WHICH THE CLIENT WAS REFERRED. FAIR HOUSING TRAININGS ARE OFFERED VIRTUALLY AND IN THE COMMUNITY.

THE FHP ALREADY HAS A GENERAL FAIR HOUSING, DISABILITY DISCRIMINATION, CRIMINAL RECORDS, TENANT RIGHTS, AND ENGLISH LANGUAGE LEARNERS\u2019 TRAININGS DEVELOPED. THESE TRAININGS ARE TRANSLATED INTO SPANISH, PORTUGUESE, AND KHMER, AND CTI WILL ENGAGE STAFF TO PROVIDE THESE TRAININGS IN THOSE LANGUAGES. PROPOSED ACTIVITIES INCLUDE ON-SITE TRAININGS FOR AT LEAST 200 PEOPLE, 100 OF WHICH WILL BE IN SPANISH, PORTUGUESE, AND KHMER AS WELL AS VIRTUAL TRAININGS. OUTREACH ACTIVITIES ARE DESIGNED TO BROADLY PROMOTE FAIR HOUSING AND AFFH ADVOCACY THROUGHOUT OUR 70 COMMUNITIES.

CTI AND THE FHP FIRMLY BELIEVE THAT FAIR HOUSING AND FURTHERING FAIR HOUSING BENEFITS EVERYONE. FHP ACTIVITIES ARE TARGETED TO INFORM AND ASSIST WITH ALL TYPES OF HOUSING DISCRIMINATION (INCLUDING SURVIVORS OF DOMESTIC VIOLENCE UNDER VAWA) AND ALL FEDERALLY PROTECTED CLASSES. THAT SAID, THE FHP ALSO UNDERSTANDS THAT SOME PEOPLE ARE MORE LIKELY TO BE DISCRIMINATED AGAINST AND ARE MORE LIKELY TO BE HARMED BY HOUSING INEQUALITIES. THE FHP USES REGIONAL DATA AND RESEARCH ALONG WITH DATA COLLECTED DURING BY CTI DURING ITS COMMUNITY NEEDS ASSESSMENT AND THE DATA COLLECTED BY THE FHP THROUGH COMPLAINT SERVICES AND TRAININGS. IN THIS CAPACITY, THE FHP HAS IDENTIFIED SEVERAL PROTECTED GROUPS AND REGIONS THAT NEED FOCUSED ATTENTION AND TARGETED PROGRAMMING. GEOGRAPHICALLY, CTI WILL ENSURE IT IS ESTABLISHING CONTACT AND PARTNERSHIPS WITH ORGANIZATIONS IN OUR HUB CITIES, WHERE THERE ARE REGIONAL CONCENTRATIONS ON PEOPLE WITH LIMITED ENGLISH PROFICIENCY (LEP). THESE SAME HUB CITIES HAVE HIGHER CONCENTRATIONS OF BLACK AND BROWN POPULATIONS. IN EXPANDING THE FHP\u2019S FAIR HOUSING TRAININGS OFFERINGS TO SPANISH, PORTUGUESE, AND KHMER, THE FHP EXPECTS IMMIGRANT, AND OTHER NON-/ OR LIMITED- ENGLISH SPEAKING RESIDENTS TO BENEFIT FROM OUTREACH, TRAININGS, AND HOPEFULLY INCREASED USE OF COMPLAINTS SERVICES. THE FHP RECEIVES A LARGE NUMBER OF COMPLAINTS ALLEGING DISABILITY DISCRIMINATION, AND EXPECTS TO SERVE A LARGE NUMBER OF PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES IN ITS COMPLAINT SERVICE. TRAININGS OFFERED TO SENIOR CENTERS AND ACO/HEALTHCARE PROVIDERS CAN FOCUS ON REASONABLE ACCOMMODATIONS AND MODIFICATIONS. AS SUCH, PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES ARE ALSO EXPECTED TO BE BENEFICIARIES.

IN RECENT YEARS, ADDITIONAL FAIR HOUSING PROTECTIONS AT THE STATE LEVEL AND FEDERAL GUIDANCE HAVE EXPANDED THE FAIR HOUSING RIGHTS OF THESE GROUPS. A LACK OF UP-TO-DATE KNOWLEDGE IN COMMUNITIES CREATES A BARRIER TO PROTECTED GROUPS ACCESSING THEIR SPECIFIC HOUSING RIGHTS AND NEEDS. THIS PROJECT WILL COUNTERACT KNOWLEDGE GAPS IN FAIR HOUSING RIGHTS AND RESPONSIBILITIES. OUTREACH IS A KEY FACTOR IN CONNECTING VICTIMS OF HOUSING DISCRIMINATION AND HOUSING PROVIDERS WITH THE TOOLS AND RESOURCES TO UNDERSTAND AND ACCESS THEIR FAIR HOUSING RIGHTS AND RESPONSIBILITIES. A MAJOR BARRIER TO ACHIEVING THIS JUSTICE IS A SIMPLE LACK OF KNOWLEDGE. THIS PROJECT SEEKS TO GO BEYOND GENERAL EDUCATION AND PROVIDE MORE SPECIFIC EDUCATION AND OUTREACH TOOLS AND RESOURCES FOR PUBLIC HOUSING AGENCIES (PHAS) AND POPULATIONS ELIGIBLE FOR OR LIVING IN PUBLIC AND SUBSIDIZED HOUSING. A MAJOR FOCUS OF THIS PROJECT WILL BE THE TREATMENT OF ARREST & CONVICTION RECORDS. ILLINOIS HAS 1.8 MILLION BLACK RESIDENTS AND 2.3 MILLION HISPANIC OR LATINO RESIDENTS. THESE TWO GROUPS ARE DISPROPORTIONATELY REPRESENTED IN ARREST & CONVICTION DATA. HOPE RECOGNIZES THE NEED FOR INCREASED EDUCATION ACROSS THE STATE OF ILLINOIS WHICH INCLUDES OVER 100 PHAS. HOPE\u2019S SERVICE AREA ALSO INCLUDES MANY VULNERABLE AND UNDERSERVED COMMUNITIES. AS THE ONLY AGENCY PROVIDING FAIR HOUSING SERVICES IN MOST OF THE FORTY COUNTIES WITHIN ITS SERVICE AREA \u2013 INCLUDING EDUCATION AND OUTREACH SERVICES \u2013 HOPE CONTINUES TO PLAY A VITAL ROLE IN PROVIDING FAIR HOUSING TRAINING, RESOURCES, AND TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE TO MEET THESE NEEDS.; ACTIVITIES TO BE PERFORMED: ACTIVITIES TO BE PERFORMED 1) UPDATE HOPE\u2019S PUBLIC HOUSING AGENCIES FAIR HOUSING MANUAL. HOPE WILL UPDATE ITS PUBLIC HOUSING AGENCIES (PHA) FAIR HOUSING MANUAL, PUBLISHED IN 2014, TO INCLUDE UPDATED GUIDANCE FROM HUD ON FAIR HOUSING LAW AS WELL AS STATE LEVEL LAWS RELEVANT TO PHAS. BY UPDATING THIS MANUAL, PHAS WILL BE BETTER INFORMED ON HOW TO FOLLOW FAIR HOUSING LAW WHEN SERVING PROTECTED GROUPS INCLUDING PERSONS WITH DISABILITIES, SURVIVORS OF DOMESTIC VIOLENCE, PERSONS WITH ARREST & CONVICTION RECORDS, AND MORE. HOPE WILL ENSURE THE DEVELOPED MANUAL IS MADE AVAILABLE TO PHAS THROUGHOUT ITS SERVICE AREA AND ACROSS THE STATE OF ILLINOIS. 2) CONDUCT PRESENTATIONS/TRAININGS ON PHA FAIR HOUSING MANUAL. TO ENSURE PHAS ARE MADE AWARE OF THEIR UPDATED FAIR HOUSING RESPONSIBILITIES, HOPE WILL CONDUCT THREE TRAININGS TO PHA STAFF ON THE UPDATED MANUAL. THROUGH THESE TRAININGS, HOPE WILL DISCUSS THE MANUAL, HIGHLIGHT KEY CHANGES AND UPDATES, AND PROVIDE AN OPPORTUNITY FOR PHA STAFF TO ASK QUESTIONS. THROUGH THESE TRAININGS, HOPE WILL CONNECT WITH PHAS, PROVIDE THEM WITH THE UPDATED PHA FAIR HOUSING MANUAL AND ANY OTHER HOPE RESOURCES OR GUIDANCE HIGHLIGHTED IN THE MANUAL OR REQUESTED BY THE PHA. 3) DEVELOP TOOLS AND RESOURCES REGARDING ARREST & CONVICTION RECORDS IN PUBLIC HOUSING. THROUGH ITS RECENT FHIP-EOI STRIVING FOR EQUITY GRANT, HOPE CREATED AN ARREST & CONVICTION RECORD TOOLKIT WHICH INCLUDED RESOURCES FOR INDIVIDUALS FACING DISCRIMINATION, FLYERS AND REFERRAL GUIDES FOR ORGANIZATIONS COUNSELING CLIENTS, AND ADVERTISING DRAFTS FOR ONLINE AND NEWSPAPER OUTREACH. HOPE WILL MODIFY THE RESOURCES IN THIS TOOLKIT TO CREATE NEW TOOLS AND RESOURCES FOR INDIVIDUALS WITH ARREST & CONVICTIONS RECORDS WHO LIVE OR SEEK TO LIVE IN PUBLIC OR SUBSIDIZED HOUSING. THE UPDATES WILL FOCUS ON HUD GUIDANCE AND ILLINOIS LAW (PUBLIC HOUSING ACCESS BILL AND HOUSING AUTHORITIES ACT). 4) DEVELOP ADVERTISING MATERIALS ADDRESSING ARREST & CONVICTION RECORD. THROUGH HOPE\u2019S DEVELOPMENT AND CREATION OF ITS ARREST & CONVICTION RECORD TOOLKIT FOR POPULATIONS ELIGIBLE FOR OR LIVING IN PUBLIC AND SUBSIDIZED HOUSING, HOPE WILL CREATE TWO SOCIAL MEDIA/ONLINE MARKETING MATERIALS SPECIFICALLY ADDRESSING FAIR HOUSING PROTECTIONS FOR THOSE WITH ARREST & CONVICTION RECORDS WHO ARE ELIGIBLE PUBLIC AND SUBSIDIZED HOUSING. ADDITIONALLY, HOPE WILL CREATE ONE DIGITAL OR ONLINE NEWSPAPER ADVERTISING ADDRESSING ARREST & CONVICTION RECORD PROTECTIONS. 5) CONDUCT ONLINE OUTREACH. HOPE WILL HOST ALL THE MATERIALS DESCRIBED ABOVE ON ITS WEBSITE AND PROMOTE THEM ON SOCIAL MEDIA PLATFORMS TO SPREAD AWARENESS. IN ADDITION, HOPE WILL CREATE ONE VIDEO SHOWCASING CLIENT TESTIMONIAL. THIS TESTIMONIAL WILL HIGHLIGHT THE EXPERIENCE OF HOPE\u2019S CLIENT(S) WHO FACED HOUSING DISCRIMINATION HOUSING DISCRIMINATION ON THE BASIS OF THEIR ARREST AND/OR CONVICTION RECORD. THE VIDEO WILL ALSO HIGHLIGHT WHERE TO SEEK HELP AND HOW TO REPORT INSTANCES OF UNLAWFUL DISCRIMINATION. THE TESTIMONIAL VIDEO WILL BE PROMOTED ACROSS HOPE\u2019S SOCIAL MEDIA PLATFORMS AND HOSTED ON ITS WEBSITE. 6) DISTRIBUTE ALL NEWLY DEVELOPED MATERIALS. ONCE HOPE HAS CREATED ITS NEW OUTREACH MATERIALS AND RECEIVED APPROVAL FROM THE GTM, FOCUS WILL SHIFT TOWARDS DISSEMINATING THE MATERIALS THROUGHOUT ILLINOIS. HOPE WILL ENGAGE DIRECTLY WITH PHAS TO DISTRIBUTE THE PHA FAIR HOUSING MANUAL (EITHER VIRTUALLY OR IN PERSON) AND LATER HOST IT ON HOPE\u2019S WEBSITE FOR PHA STAFF AND INTERESTED PARTIES TO ACCESS. HOPE WILL DISTRIBUTE THE ARREST & CONVICTION RECORD TOOLKIT VIA SOCIAL MEDIA PLATFORMS AND ITS WEBSITE.

HOPE WILL ENSURE THE DEVELOPED MANUAL IS MADE AVAILABLE FOR DOWNLOAD TO OVER 100 PHAS ACROSS THE STATE OF ILLINOIS THROUGH ITS WEBSITE. HOPE WILL CONDUCT AT LEAST THREE FAIR HOUSING EDUCATIONAL TRAININGS FOR PHA STAFF THROUGHOUT HOPE\u2019S SERVICE AREA. HOPE WILL CREATE TWO ONLINE/SOCIAL MEDIA ADS, ONE DIGITAL OR PRINT NEWSPAPER AD, AND ONE TESTIMONIAL VIDEO TO ENGAGE IN DIGITAL OUTREACH. THIS ONLINE OUTREACH WILL ALLOW HOPE TO REACH THOUSANDS OF INDIVIDUALS ACROSS ITS SEVERAL ONLINE PLATFORMS. HOPE WILL ADDITIONALLY CREATE A TOOLKIT ADDRESSING RELEVANT ARREST & CONVICTION RECORD PROTECTIONS FOR THOSE SEEKING OR CURRENTLY RESIDING IN PUBLIC AND SUBSIDIZED HOUSING. THE TOOLKIT WILL BE ACCESSED BY AN ESTIMATED 100 INDIVIDUALS. INTENDED BENEFICIARIES THE GRANT PROJECT WILL PROVIDE SIGNIFICANT BENEFITS TO PHA STAFF ACROSS ILLINOIS\u2019 MORE THAN 100 HOUSING AUTHORITIES, THE MORE THAN 224,000 ILLINOIS HOUSEHOLDS UTILIZING SOME FORM OF FEDERAL RENTAL ASSISTANCE, 1 AS WELL AS THE THOSE SEEKING OR CURRENTLY RESIDING IN PUBLIC OR SUBSIDIZED HOUSING.
